## üß† SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### üß™ **Mechanics That Boost Positive Egregors**

| System / Mechanic                      | Impact on Positive Egregors                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heartfire Communion**                | Raises egregor score and **generates immunity to Xevir's tethers** for bonded allies.                                             |
| **Philosopher‚Äôs Stone Protocol**       | Positive egregors are **required for all life-affirming Stones**, e.g., Stone of Divine Equilibrium, Blooming Apotheosis.         |
| **Egregor Shards**                     | Embedding positive shards into armor, weapons, or soul-bonds **creates resistance or rebuke effects** against corrupted egregors. |
| **Despair Score Effects**              | Despair Score ‚â§ 3 empowers positive egregors. At ‚â• 6, positive egregors start **‚Äúflickering‚Äù** unless ritual-anchored.            |
| **Mirrorlight & Vizardika Initiation** | Mirrorlight amplifies their presence. Initiated Vizardika users may ‚Äúsee‚Äù and **tune emotional threads** during rituals.          |
| **The Sokowe Soulbond**                | Sokowe PC/NPCs bound to positive egregors gain **partial immunity to Xeviric aura** as long as they don‚Äôt forsake their egregor.  |
