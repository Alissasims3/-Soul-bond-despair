# 💔 **Despair System: The Descent into Longing**

_A corruption, mutation, and soul-shaping mechanic designed for Xevir campaigns._

---

## 🔻 **Despair Score (DS): Your Descent Tracker**

Each character has a **Despair Score (0–20)**, reflecting their corruption level. DS can increase due to trauma, exposure, rituals, or failed saves against Xevir's influence.

|**Despair Score**|**Corruption Stage**|**Effects**|
|---|---|---|
|0|Stage 0 – _Resilient_|No mutations. May have passive resistance to despair-based effects.|
|1–4|Stage 1 – _Initial Whisper_|1–2 minor mutations (roll d100 on corruption table). Disadvantage on first mental check/day.|
|5–9|Stage 2 – _Gnawing Doubt_|Total of 3–5 mutations. Obsession emerges. Charisma checks suffer.|
|10–14|Stage 3 – _Consuming Void_|6–8 mutations. Psychic unease aura. Physical changes appear. Save DCs worsen.|
|15–19|Stage 4 – _Twisted Apex_|Full transformation likely. Permanent memory loss. Aberrant gifts.|
|20|🩸 _Harvested by Xevir_|Immediate transformation into a **unique Xevirian Entity** or **Chosen Vessel** (DM’s design).|

> **Mutation Thresholds** are determined by DS score. Some effects (like emotional exposure or healing rituals) can reduce DS, though rarely and with a cost.

## ⚙️ **Mechanics of Mutation & Corruption**

### ✅ **Trigger Events**

- Prolonged time in a corrupted zone (1 DS per 3 days in [[🏰 City of Black Obedience]] or similar)
    
- Failing Xevir-based **Wisdom or Charisma saves**
    
- Experiencing emotional trauma (betrayal, loss, guilt, abandonment)
    
- Participating in dark Vizardika rituals, even passively
    
- Accepting **gifts, boons, or whispers** from Xevir
    

### 📉 **Reducing Despair**

- Successful **Alchemical Love Ritual** (e.g. _Heartfire Communion_) → Reduce DS by 1–3
    
- Restoring a lost memory or healing another’s despair → Reduce DS by 1
    
- Confronting your own trauma in a controlled, ritualized way → Reduce DS by 1 (once per arc)
    

Despair **cannot** be cured with _Greater Restoration_, _Remove Curse_, or _Wish_. It must be earned back emotionally or alchemically.

## 🎲 **Mutation Rolls (When Reaching New Stage)**

When crossing into a new stage, the character rolls on the **[[🩸 Xevir's_Corruption_Table_(d100)]]** for new mutations. The roll ranges are:

- **Stage 1:** 01–40 → Minor Whispers
    
- **Stage 2:** 41–75 → Twisted Gifts
    
- **Stage 3:** 76–90 → Soul Scars
    
- **Stage 4:** 91–100 → Consuming Forms
    

Each roll should **match the PC’s dominant unresolved emotion or trauma**, or reflect how their despair manifests.

## 👁️‍🗨️ **Optional Rule: Despair Conditions**

These are conditions triggered by specific DS thresholds, roleplayed **in addition to** normal status effects.

|**DS Threshold**|**Despair Condition**|
|---|---|
|5|**Obsession**: Choose one object/person/goal. If denied it, disadvantage on all mental saves.|
|10|**Emotional Erosion**: You must pass a DC 15 Charisma save to express true emotion.|
|15|**Fragmented Self**: Your character develops a **Corruption Persona**—a voice or vision that haunts them and may take control during high stress (DM intrusion, once per session).|
|20|**Devoured**: You are now a creature of Xevir. The character may be reintroduced later as a BBEG, mirror-self, or despair echo.|

---

## 👑 **Becoming a Chosen Vessel (Stage 4+)**

Characters reaching **Stage 4** may become **"Chosen"** by Xevir. This occurs if they meet one of the following:

- Have a **high Despair Score (18+)**
    
- Have a **unique soul signature or powerful lineage** (e.g., Isolde)
    
- Have committed an act of **intimate betrayal or profaned love**
    

### 🩸 **The Injection (Dark Apotheosis)**

This occurs either during combat (via Xevir’s tendril strike on a dying target) or as a ritual administered by a **Fanatic Surgeon**. Roll a **DC 25 Constitution saving throw**:

- **Success:** The character becomes a **High Vessel** — part-person, part-divinity, wielding unique powers but forever warped (mechanically: apply a **custom template or Mythic Boon**, but lose free will in specific situations).
    
- **Failure:** The body combusts in **aegis-consuming flame**. The soul is locked inside Xevir’s vault, potentially becoming a boss encounter or whispering entity later.

## 🌿 **Healing Corruption (Player Options)**

### 🌕 **Alchemical Love Rituals** _(see Heartfire Communion)_

Must involve:

- True, mutual emotional bonds
    
- Personal sacrifice
    
- Willingness to confront one’s inner longing
    

Success:

- **Reduces DS by 1–3**
    
- **Restores one memory**
    
- **Provides temporary immunity to despair effects for 24 hours**
    

Failure:

- Despair increases by 1
    
- A **Shadow Reflection** manifests (CR varies)
    
- The ritual backfires, applying a new mutation
    

### 🧠 **Cleanse with Memory Threads**

Fragments of uncorrupted memory, stored in relics or sacred places, may be used in rituals to **“patch” emotional wounds**. May act as components in healing or egregor defense.

## 📜 Narrative Tools for GMs

- **Use DS as an Invisible Counter**: Players don’t need to know their DS score. Instead, give symptoms. Reveal their progression through physical, emotional, or relational breakdowns.
    
- **Stage-Based Scene Triggers**: Use thresholds (DS 5, 10, 15) to trigger flashbacks, intrusive dreams, or hallucinations, each centered around **the character’s unresolved emotion**.
    
- **Integrate Despair into Leveling**: At DS 10+, you can offer **“Despair Leveling”**: XP comes with a twist (you gain power, but also mutation or memory loss).
    

---

## 🎭 Optional Feature: **Despair Persona**

When a character reaches **Stage 3**, the DM may work with the player to define their **"inner corruption voice"**—a personification of their trauma, whispering false comfort or brutal truths.

This persona may:

- Offer power at a cost
    
- Interject with suggestions (like a devil on the shoulder)
    
- Occasionally **possess the character** (1 round per long rest, unless resisted)
