# üíé **Egregor Shards: Echoes of Emotion, Keys to Power**

_"Every powerful feeling leaves a mark. Some marks‚Ä¶ you can pick up."_

## üìñ Overview: Crystallized Emotion

**Egregor Shards** are glittering, crystalline fragments‚Äîcondensed pockets of metaphysical energy that form when an **Egregor's presence is powerfully identified, understood, or disrupted**. They are the tangible remnants of profound emotional resonance, echoing the [[Codex Egregora|Egregor's core emotion]] (love, despair, rage, hope, control, etc.).

- **Appearance:** They might vary in color and shimmer based on their origin (e.g., a **Despair Shard** could be a cold, buzzing obsidian fragment; a **Love Shard** a warm, rose-gold crystal; a **Rage Shard** a jagged, pulsating crimson; a **Memory Shard** a clear, shifting quartz).

## üì• Acquisition: Unearthing Emotional Truths

Egregor Shards are not found randomly; they are _earned_ through engagement with the metaphysical landscape.

- **Trigger:** When the PCs successfully identify a dominant Egregor in an encounter or location, or when they actively disrupt or resolve a powerful egregor (e.g., performing a [[Love in Xevir's World_ The Alchemical Heart of Reality|Heartfire Communion]] on a corrupted egregor, or forcing [[ü©∏Xevir_The_God_of_Longing|Xevir]]‚Äôs direct egregor to recoil).
- **Award:** The DM awards 1-3 Egregor Shards per qualifying encounter. More potent or "Incarnate" Egregors (like [[The Boundless Despair]] or [[Incarnate Egregor of Love_ The Boundless Devotion.md|The Boundless Devotion]]) might yield rarer, larger, or more powerful shards, or even unique Egregor-specific relics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Infusion: Imbuing Power with Feeling

Egregor Shards can be ritually infused into other artifacts or items, granting them new properties tied to the shard‚Äôs emotional essence.

- **Process:** Requires a short ritual (e.g., 10 minutes during a short rest, or 1 hour during a long rest) involving meditation on the shard's emotion and the item's purpose. It might require an Arcana or Religion check (DC 13-15) based on the shard's power.
- **Cost:** Infusion might require a minor personal cost from the infuser (e.g., 1d4 psychic damage, 1 point of [[The Descent into Longing_ Xevir's Harvest & Manifestation.md|Despair Score]] increase, or expending a spell slot).
- **Result:** The infused item gains a new, passive property or an activated ability, reflecting the Egregor's nature. An item can typically only hold 1 Egregor Shard at a time. The shard is consumed in the process.

## üåü Example Infusion Perks (Choose 1 when infusing)

Here are examples of perks, categorized by the Egregor's [[Codex Egregora|Emotional Core Tag]]:

## üß© Integration with Campaign Mechanics

- **[[The Descent into Longing_ Xevir's Harvest & Manifestation.md|Despair System]]:** Using shards, especially negative ones, can increase your Despair Score. Healing rituals might require specific positive egregors.

- **[[Love in Xevir's World_ The Alchemical Heart of Reality|Alchemical Love]]:** Creating strong positive egregors is key to generating these shards.

- **Loot & Reward:** This provides a unique, thematic reward for investigation, roleplay, and facing psychological challenges.

- **NPCs:** [[üêæ Cleric_Leopold]] might recognize these shards and trade for them. [[Fronto_the_Paranoid_Hag]] might be able to identify rarer ones.

- **Factions:** Xevir's cultists might specifically hunt for negative egregors, while the Rebellion seeks positive ones.
