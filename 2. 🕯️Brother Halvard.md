Excellent clarification — let's update **Brother Halvard** to properly reflect his true allegiance to the **Dark Majesty Cult**, not the Sporekind Hive Father. Here's the refined and faction-corrected version of his NPC dossier:

# 🕯️ Brother Halvard

_“I do not cure suffering. I place it into obedient order.”_

## 🧬 GENERAL INFORMATION

- **Faction:** **The Fanatical Zealots** (_sub-cell of the Dark Majesty Cult_)
- **Allegiance:** **Dark Majesty Cult** (servant of Xevir)

## 📜 DESCRIPTION

A gaunt, composed man clad in snow-white robes and always impeccably clean. His voice rarely rises, and he watches with surgical precision. Halvard carries himself like a healer, but his gentle touch hides the cold cruelty of his beliefs. Refugees feel both comfort and dread in his presence — the instinct of prey before a predator that smells like medicine.

---

## 🧠 PERSONALITY

- **Traits:** Detached, logical, eerily soothing
- **Ideals:** _Obedience is peace. Pain is disorder undone._
- **Bonds:** Loyal to Xevir’s purpose and Seraphine’s mission within the caravan
- **Flaws:** Sees people as systems to be rewritten, not individuals
- **Fears:** Spiritual failure—being deemed unworthy of Xevir's final evolution
- **Likes:** Clean surgical procedures, obedient patients, silent prayers
- **Dislikes:** Emotional rebellion, disorder, “romantic” attachments

---

## 🧩 REVISED MOTIVATION

While **masquerading as a healer**, Halvard’s **true role is experimental conversion**: using wounded bodies and the edge of death to test how deeply Xevir’s spores or mutations can be embedded. He doesn't serve the **Hive Father**, but rather tests **how to _weaponize_ Hive-born spores** as a branch of **Dark Majesty doctrine**. His goal is to discover **"ritual obedience mutations"**—the ability to physically encode obedience into the flesh.

> _“If we can make the body sing loyalty, the soul will follow.”_

## 🧪 SPECIAL ABILITIES

### 🩸 **Sorrow Extraction (1/Day):**

As an action, Halvard may touch a creature and draw out a traumatic memory. Target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or take 3d6 psychic damage and be charmed by Halvard until the end of their next turn. Halvard gains temporary HP equal to half the damage dealt.

### 🧠 **Memory Graft (Ritual):**

Given access to a corpse or unconscious target, Halvard can implant a fragment of "scripture"—Xevir's rewritten truth—into their mind. This has no immediate effect but sets the creature up for future corruption (GM Plot Hook).

---

## 💼 EQUIPMENT

- Surgical kit (ornately carved, containing hidden Xevirian glyphs)
- Bone scalpel wrapped in silver filigree (his spell focus)
- Necklace with two sides: a Naivaran crescent moon, and a hidden red eye of Xevir
- Journal of “dreams” (psychic torture blueprints and obedience formulas)

---

## 🧬 LIFESTYLE IN THE CARAVAN

- **Public Role:** The caravan’s calm and capable doctor. Trusted by Captain X’sa due to proven skill.
- **True Role:** Field researcher for the **Dark Majesty**, testing **obedience-linked mutations**, monitoring Seraphine's progress, and preparing potential vessels for ritual implantation.
- **Living Conditions:** Modest covered wagon with thick curtains, scalpel racks, and perfumed herbs to mask the stench of work.
- **Allies:**

    - **Sister Lira** (his devout wife, equally cold and calculating)
    - **Seraphine & Mira** (he respects her vision and tests her theories)
    - **“Prophet” Malk** (sees him as a necessary instability—a firestarter)
- **Suspects:**
    - **Captain Rigadzz X’sa** (senses something wrong)
    - **Lola Deliury** (her proximity to truth is dangerous)

---

## 🔐 SECRETS & PLOT HOOKS

- **Hybrid Research:** Halvard keeps hidden notes on combining Sporekind traits with **ritual brainwashing** to create “Perfect Obedients”—blank-souled enforcers with beautiful symmetry and utter loyalty.
- **Lira's Lullabies:** His wife sings mutated Naivaran hymns that plant suggestions in children’s minds.
- **Soul Cage:** One of Halvard’s tools is a shard of [[The Vault of the Mind]]—used to "store" a patient’s memory before erasing them.
- **Corruption Seed:** He has a living test subject—an NPC child or refugee who seems normal… but hears the cult in their dreams.

## 🎭 ROLEPLAYING HALVARD

- **Voice:** Calm, low, precise. Rarely changes inflection.
    
- **Body Language:** Stiff but deliberate. Touches things like they are fragile glass.
- **Quotes:**
    > “The body is merely a hymn unfinished.”  
    > “Truth is not remembered. It is shaped.”  
    > “When they forget what love is… they will love Him best.”
