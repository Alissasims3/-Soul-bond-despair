## 📖 Chapter I: **The Setup – "The Ember Enters the Throne"**

### 🎴 Dramatic Summary (Narration for DM or Voiceover):

> “The Tower of Obedience stands taller than memory. Its walls pulse. Its whispers sing.
> Deep inside it, on a throne of writhing longing, sits Xevir — the god that devoured pain, then made it home.
> And now\... fire climbs his stair.”

### 🏰 Setting the Scene

* **Location**: Xevir’s Inner Sanctum, atop the Tower of Obedience.
* **Visual Cues**:

  * Floor: Glossy black stone that *sighs* when stepped on.
  * Walls: Ribcage-like arches of bone and organ.
  * Ceiling: A dome of transparent tendrils, showing a dead red sun.
* **Background Effects**:

  * A psychic choir hums continuously (Aegrogoric Pressure).
  * Emotional gravity increases. All creatures feel their worst memory tugged at.

### 🎮 DM Mechanics

* **Environmental Layer Effect**:
  At the start of each round, all creatures in the tower must make a DC 15 Wisdom save or suffer disadvantage on Insight, Investigation, or Perception until end of turn. (This intensifies each phase.)

* **Xevir's Presence** *(pre-armor removal)*:

  * CR: 25
  * Legendary Actions: 3
  * Symbiotic Armor: Damage immunity to non-radiant, non-force. Timer-based removal.
  * Egregoric Aura: All creatures who experience \[Love], \[Shame], or \[Despair] are affected by Longing field effects.

## 🎭 Opening Dialogue — **Anime Style** (Escanor vs Chrollo Vibe)

> **\[Aisyle, eyes glowing like dawnfire, coin in hand]**
> *“Is this what you call a kingdom? A cathedral of cowards carved from obedience?”*

> **\[Xevir, seated, not moving, voice like velvet folded around razors]**
> *“It is peace. But you see fire, so you burn it. Tell me, little ember—when your flame dies, who will remember your heat?”*

> **\[Aisyle, flicking her coin upward without looking]**
> *“Tails.”*
> *(Her aura ignites.)*
> *“Then I don’t die today.”*

> **\[Xevir, standing at last]**
> *“You walk into the furnace thinking you are the fire.”*
> *(He removes one glove — his hand gleams obsidian, veins filled with moving eyes.)*
> *“But even gods kneel here.”*

## 🎯 Tactical Goals for Players (or Aisyle):

* **Objective:** Reach and weaken Xevir by stripping his armor and surviving psychic attacks.
* **Secondary Objective:** Preserve memory fragments (avoid Intelligence-drain effects).
* **Environmental Puzzle:** Use solar magic or emotional resonance to trigger tower’s feedback pulse (weakening Xevir’s control).
* **Mythic Timer:** After 5 rounds, Xevir begins Phase 2. On Round 7, armor fails unless manually disrupted earlier.

## 🧩 Phase Mechanics (Setup Only Preview)

| Element                | Effect                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Egregor Layer          | Activates “Contagion of Longing” → Wisdom saves or disadvantage                                    |
| Whisper Choir          | Triggers illusions (DM Choice): visions of lost loved ones                                         |
| Coin of Final Judgment | Aisyle’s unique pre-fight ability. If “Tails,” she ignores 1st death.                              |
| Xevir’s Gaze           | Each round, 1 target must roll CHA save DC 18 or be “seen” — next attack gains max psychic damage. |

### 🧧 DM Tips

* Set the **emotional tone** as much as mechanical tension. This is a clash of philosophies—Xevir offers peace through stillness, Aisyle insists that living means burning.
* Begin **slow** and **reverent**, then build through the chapters to high-octane divine violence.
* Remind players often of the **emotional weight** (love, rage, longing) by cueing environmental whispers and psychic echo descriptions.
