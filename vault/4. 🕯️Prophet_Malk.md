**Prophet Malk**, also known as **Junior Priest Malk**, is a character who serves as a **covert agent and evangelist for the Dark Majesty Cult**, outwardly masquerading as a priest of Naivara.

Here's a breakdown of Prophet Malk:

*   **Identity and Role**
    *   **Race/Type:** He is a human, functioning as a cleric, though his true alignment and methods are deceptive.
    *   **Public Persona:** He presents himself as a **spiritual guide** in caravans and a priest of Naivara. He appears enthusiastic, poetic, and slightly unhinged. In the Green Church District of Hallows Edge, he potentially influences schools or public services.
    *   **True Allegiance:** Malk is a member of **The Fanatical Zealots**, a sub-cell of the **Dark Majesty Cult**, which is Xevir's official and mandatory faith. He is a fully committed zealot. His allegiance to the Dark Majesty Cult means he serves Xevir, the God of Longing.
    *   **True Belief:** While outwardly a Naivara priest, he **reinterprets Naivara’s doctrine** through the lens of Xevir’s "beautiful decay". He secretly serves a form of Naivara called "The Death That Remembers" but distorts its principles. He is seen as a "necessary instability" and a "firestarter" by other zealots like Brother Halvard.

*   **Methods and Influence**
    *   **Deceptive Ceremonies:** He oversees funerals and rites, but his "Naivaran" ceremonies may, in fact, **offer the dead to Xevir**.
    *   **Memory-Plague Seeds:** He can plant **"memory-plague seeds" in mourning minds**, a tactic to spread Xevir's influence.
    *   **Hidden Hymns:** He leads public burials and sermons that contain **hidden hymns to Xevir**.
    *   **Propaganda:** He contributes to the **"Survival & Sanity Guides"** section of the Hallows Press, providing tips for resisting Xevir's influence, coping with psychic strain, and remembering one's own face.
    *   **Psychological Manipulation:** He, along with other zealots, spreads Xevir's influence through psychological manipulation, emotional infection, and spiritual erosion.

*   **Connections and Plot Hooks**
    *   **Zealot Network:** He is part of the coordinated network of Fanatical Zealots, including Brother Halvard and Sister Lira, who infiltrate communities and disguise their true roles.
    *   **Corruption Tracking:** Signs of his activities include unmarked graves yielding fungi, indicating his burial rites.
    *   **Danger Level:** He is considered a high-danger NPC who may attempt open conversion rituals if left unchecked.
    *   **Specific Hooks:** Grave sites where Malk performed burials may begin to **sprout blue fungus**, which in turn attracts Sporekind scouts.

In essence, Prophet Malk is a dangerous, morally ambiguous figure who uses the guise of spiritual comfort and healing to further the agenda of Xevir's mind-controlling cult, twisting traditional rites to serve a dark purpose.
