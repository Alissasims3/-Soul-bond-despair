## 🧠 **Despair Score Mechanic (5e-Compatible)**

> **Despair Score** is a cumulative measure of a character’s psychological and spiritual erosion due to exposure to Xevir, the God of Longing.
> Despair increases through trauma, corruption, or psychic contact with Xevir or his domain.
> **Each 5 points of Despair triggers a mutation.**

### 📊 Despair Score Table

| **Despair Score** | **Stage** | **Mutation Category** | **Save DC for Resistance** |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1–5               | Stage I   | Minor Whisper         | DC 10 (WIS)                |
| 6–10              | Stage II  | Twisted Gift          | DC 12 (CHA)                |
| 11–15             | Stage III | Soul Scar             | DC 15 (INT)                |
| 16+               | Stage IV  | Consuming Form        | DC 18 (WIS or CHA)         |

* **DM’s Discretion:** Despair score may rise based on roleplay, narrative failures, exposure to corrupted artifacts, witnessing atrocities, or willingly accepting Xevir's gifts.
* **Mutation Save:** On gaining a new mutation, the character may attempt a saving throw. On success, the mutation is **suppressed** but not removed.

### 🎭 Obsessive Gaze

*Twisted Gift*
**Type:** Action (1/Short Rest)

Fix your gaze on a humanoid within 30 feet. If they fail, they become **Obsessed** (Charmed) for 1 minute. They constantly seek your approval. Ends if you harm them.

## 🔥 Redemption Mechanics

Characters may **attempt to reduce Despair** (or remove a mutation) through extreme acts of faith, atonement, or metaphysical re-alignment.

| **Path**             | **Mechanic**                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Divine Purge         | Cast *Greater Restoration* and succeed DC 18 WIS Save → remove 1 mutation |
| Self-Sacrifice       | Give up something deeply tied to your identity (DM defines) → -1 Despair  |
| Egregor Counterforce | Fulfill the opposite emotional act of the mutation’s source → suppress it |
| Blood Cleansing      | Receive blood from a divine host (e.g. Aisyle) → reroll mutation table    |

> 🔐 *Note: Some mutations are permanent unless **Sólvenar's Light** or equivalent divine judgment intervenes.*

**Mutation Concept:** “Flesh fractals growing over one eye, hiding iris behind golden glass shards. Shadowy hands erupt from spine under stress.”
