Got it! Let‚Äôs break down **Exploding Dice (Heroic Hits)** in a way that‚Äôs clear for your D\&D campaign. ‚ú®

# üé≤ Exploding Dice (Heroic Hits)

### **Core Idea**

When you roll the **maximum value** on a die, you roll it again and **add the new result** to the total.

* This can chain infinitely, meaning the die can ‚Äúexplode‚Äù multiple times.
* The mechanic rewards critical effort and adds cinematic unpredictability to damage, checks, or special moments.

---

## **How It Works Step-by-Step**

1. **Roll a die** (attack damage, skill check, saving throw, etc.).
2. **If you hit the maximum** (e.g., an 8 on a d8, or a 20 on a d20):

   * Roll that die again.
   * Add the new roll to the previous total.
3. **Repeat** if the new roll is also maximum.

   * Example: Roll a d8 for damage ‚Üí get an **8** ‚Üí roll again ‚Üí get **8** ‚Üí roll again ‚Üí get **5**.
     **Total = 8 + 8 + 5 = 21.**

## **When to Use Heroic Hits**

You can choose where in your campaign this applies. Common options:

* **Damage Rolls Only** (keeps combat exciting).
* **Skill Checks & Saves** (allows for dramatic ‚Äúsuperhuman‚Äù successes).
* **Critical Hits Only** (exploding dice trigger when a crit is scored).

## **Why Add This Mechanic?**

‚úÖ Adds **unpredictability & excitement**
‚úÖ Creates **legendary story moments** (‚Äúmy rogue shot an arrow for 60 damage in one shot!‚Äù)
‚úÖ Fits **dark, high-stakes campaigns** like Xevir (chaos & destiny in dice)

---

## **Optional Tweaks**

* **Cap explosions** (e.g., max 2 extra rolls).
* **Heroic Threshold** (explosions only happen when narratively dramatic, like saving an ally or facing a boss).
* **Player-Only Rule** (lets heroes shine).

---

‚öîÔ∏è Example in Play:

* Thrakka swings his greataxe (1d12 damage).
* Rolls **12** ‚Üí explodes!
* Rolls another **12** ‚Üí explodes again!
* Rolls **10**.
* **Total Damage = 34** (and the table goes wild).

Do you want me to write this up as a **one-page player handout** (like a rule card) that you can drop into Owlbear or show your group?
