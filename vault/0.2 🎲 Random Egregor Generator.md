# 🎲 **Random Egregor Generator**

_A GM’s tool for forging living emotional bonds in a world that devours them._

## ⚙️ Structure

The generator is built from **four core tables**, rolled or selected in sequence:

1. **Bond Type (Who/What is the bond with?)**
2. **Emotional Core (What feeling formed the egregor?)**
3. **Memory Catalyst (What moment crystallized it?)**
4. **Manifestation & Mechanics (How does it show up in play?)**

You may also include:

- A **Corruption Risk Tag**
- A **Codex Entry Seed Name**
