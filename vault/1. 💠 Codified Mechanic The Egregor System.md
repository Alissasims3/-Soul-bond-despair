# 💠 **Codified Mechanic: The Egregor System**

_“You are what you carry within you. And sometimes… it carries you.”_

## 🔗 What is an Egregor?

In the world of Xevir, an **Egregor** is a metaphysical construct of **shared emotional resonance**—formed through strong feelings between people, objects, ideas, or even places. They can be:

- 🕊️ **Positive Egregors** (Love, Loyalty, Joy, Hope, Sacrifice)
- 🩸 **Negative Egregors** (Obsession, Control, Shame, Despair, Regret)
- 🎭 **Twisted Egregors** (Xeviric hybrids of corrupted love)

These egregors affect reality. They can shield, transform, dominate, or consume. Most are **invisible**, but their effects ripple outward. Cultists of Xevir actively harvest, manipulate, or shatter them.

## 📊 **Egregor Score (0–10 scale)**

Every bond or emotional tie (person-to-person, person-to-place, etc.) has an **Egregor Score**, reflecting its intensity and purity.

|Score|Category|Description|
|---|---|---|
|0|Dormant|Indifference, denial, or suppression.|
|1–3|Flickering|Early trust, faint memories, potential affection.|
|4–6|Kindled|Active love, close friendship, shared purpose.|
|7–9|Radiant|Deep, sacrificial love or loyalty; powerful memories.|
|10|Incarnate|Legendary bond; capable of **resisting or unmaking Xevir.**|

> Players may track **up to 3 Egregors** at a time (more = emotional overload = vulnerability).

---

## 🧪 **Egregor Tags & Nature**

Each Egregor is assigned one or more **Tags**, defining its resonance:

- 🔥 _Passion_ (can ignite strength or fury)
- 🌿 _Compassion_ (defends, heals, anchors)
- ⚖️ _Duty_ (steady, logical, long-lived)
- 🌑 _Obsession_ (sticky, unstable, corruptible)
- 🌪️ _Grief_ (volatile, volatile, can heal or destroy)
- 🪞 _Memory_ (focuses clarity, grants resistance to forgetfulness)
- 🩸 _Control_ (used by Xevir to convert bonds)

---

## 🎲 **Egregor Tests (Optional Mechanics)**

When a bond is challenged—during Xeviric intrusion, or trauma—a PC can attempt an **Egregor Test** to draw on its power.

**DC = 15 + (Xevir’s proximity modifier, 0–5)**  
**Roll = CHA or WIS + Egregor Score**

**Success:**

- Temporary resistance to corruption
- Radiant pulse (1d8 psychic to Xevir’s influence)
- Bonus action _Inspiration_ or _Memory Clarity_ (advantage on one save)

**Critical Success (Nat 20):**

- Restore 1 lost memory
- Reduce Despair Score by 1
- Burn Egregor once: allies auto-pass Wisdom saves for 1 minute


**Failure:**

- Lose 1 point of that Egregor’s score
- Xevir may “Whisper” through that bond
- (If corrupted) Egregor becomes **Inverted** for 24 hours

---

## ☠️ **Inverted Egregors**

When corrupted by Xevir, an egregor **flips polarity**, becoming a weapon or tether:

- **Compassion → Pity → Control**
- **Loyalty → Blind Devotion**
- **Grief → Numbness → Longing**
- **Passion → Rage → Obsession**

> Inverted Egregors can become **Xeviric Brands**, visible only under true love or mirrorlight.

---

## 🔐 **Reprogramming & Breaking Egregors**

Egregors can be manipulated by magic (love rituals), traumatic events, or Xeviric corruption.

### 📖 Rituals That Affect Egregors:

- **Heartfire Communion (Pure):** Can restore, intensify, or shield egregors.
- **Rite of the Mirror Veil (Corrupt):** Inverts the bond, enslaves the partner, creates a psychic tether.
- **Vault-Key Rites:** Advanced Vizardika rituals stored in [[📚The_Library_of_the_Mind]]; used by Xeviric high priests to forcibly reassign egregors.

## 🎖️ **Roleplay Benefits of High Egregors**

|Score|Benefit|
|---|---|
|4+|Gain **advantage** on Insight checks to sense deception around the bonded person or object.|
|6+|Can always **detect their presence** within 120 feet (as a feeling or thread).|
|7+|Xevir **cannot fully see** or influence your actions related to that bond (1/day).|
|10|You and your bonded target may **resist a complete memory wipe or possession** (one time). This score may unlock **joint resistances**, **aura effects**, or **custom feats.**|

---

## 🧬 Integration with Other Systems

- 🌑 **Despair Score:** High Egregors protect against Despair increases and may delay mutation effects.
- 🧠 **Xevir's Influence:** High egregors cause **pain** to Xevir or minions when touched.
- 🌀 **Alchemical Class Paths:** Subclasses like _Paladin of the Alchemical Heart_ gain scaling bonuses based on their highest egregor.
