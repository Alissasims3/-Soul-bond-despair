## 🧿 **The Unseen Eye**

*A psychic brand. A prison. A masterpiece of devotion.*

---

### 🔥 **Visual Description**

> A single, elegant, stylized eye glows in golden-iron light at the nape of her neck, just beneath the hairline. The eye is complex: delicate lashes arc in runic patterns, the sclera hums with dull warmth, and the iris, though luminous, is **fractured**—like a mirror that has been cracked from within.
>
> Under moonlight, the pupil **contracts and dilates** slowly, almost as if breathing. When exposed to intense psychic energy (especially involving Xevir), the eye flares brightly, and the **shattered iris shifts**—for a split second forming the image of **a throne**, **a mask**, or **a child reaching for a crown**.

---

### 🕯️ **Symbolism**

* **The Eye Itself**: A direct manifestation of Xevir’s gaze—beautiful, divine, and controlling. It is not a symbol of wisdom or enlightenment, but of *possession*.

* **Placement**: On the back of the neck—visible to everyone but Isolde herself. A cruel irony: her friends can see she is marked, but she cannot. A perfect metaphor for **control through ignorance**.

* **The Shattered Iris**: The moment of the “False Victory” frozen in time, etched into her flesh. She did not see the truth—and so she was *branded* with the lie.

---

### 💬 **Xevir's Message (delivered telepathically the moment it appears):**

> *“You sought truth beyond the veil, and so I gave you an eye that sees only what I allow. Let it watch the world for you, my daughter. You have seen enough.”*

### 🧠 **Narrative Mechanics (Optional)**

If you want this scar to have a mechanical or narrative weight, consider the following options:

#### ✴️ **Passive Effect – Divine Surveillance**

Isolde cannot be **scryed upon** by normal means—but Xevir always knows her general emotional state and location. (DM fiat or once per long rest.)

#### 🌙 **Moonlight Trigger**

Under moonlight, allies who pass a DC 18 Insight check can tell that the eye is *watching them back*.

#### 🧩 **Plot Hook – "Mirror-Eye Syndrome"**

In Season Two (post-rewind), Isolde begins to feel a “phantom” presence behind her every time she speaks Xevir’s name. Sometimes, **what she says isn’t what she meant to say.**
