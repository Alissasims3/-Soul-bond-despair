| **Resonance Risk**      | Moderate to High (depends on user’s Despair Score and egregor integrity)                                   |
| **Vulnerability**       | Susceptible to *Egregor Inversion*, especially via despair events or misuse of Vizardika                   |
| **Immunity**            | Cannot be forcibly inverted if the bearer maintains Despair Score ≤ 3 and is in active Vizardika alignment |
| **Role**                | Mirrors intent — ideal for ritual programming, emotional catalysts, and mutable artifacts                  |

## 🌀 **Neutral Egregor Entries** *(Initial Selection)*

---

### ⚖️ *\[Balance]*

> *“The silence between two heartbeats.”*

* **Tags:** Equilibrium, duality, restraint, acceptance
* **Usage:** Often used in Sokowe rites to harmonize conflicting egregors during emotional storms
* **Mechanics:**

  * Grants **advantage on saving throws** vs effects that target emotions (charm, fear, rage).
  * When combined with \[Hope] or \[Despair], acts as an egregor "anchor" to suppress inversions.
* **Risks:** If one's Despair Score exceeds 8, \[Balance] may invert into **\[Denial]**.

---

### 🕰️ *\[Memory]*

> *“What remains when names are forgotten.”*

* **Tags:** Legacy, clarity, remembrance
* **Usage:** Featured in rituals of resistance against mind-wipe spells, ego fragmentation, and soul tethers
* **Mechanics:**

  * Provides **advantage on saves vs. confusion, feeblemind, or magical amnesia**.
  * **Infusing a Memory Egregor Shard** into an item makes it immune to Xevir’s aura of forgetfulness.
* **Risks:** Can be corrupted into **\[Fractured Memories]** or consumed by **The Hollow Refrain** if exposed to despair.
* **Instability Risk:** Medium at Despair Score 5+, High at 10+

---

### 🪞 *\[Reflection]*

> *“See yourself. Truly.”*

* **Tags:** Self-awareness, transformation, clarity, introspection
* **Usage:** Mirrors the true emotional state of the bonded — used in Vizardika mirror rites
* **Mechanics:**

  * Once per long rest, user may **cleanse one Inverted Egregor** with successful Wisdom save (DC = 10 + current Despair Score).
  * Wearing a reflection-bonded amulet allows insight into **others' egregoric state**.
* **Risks:** Can be forcibly inverted into **\[The Judge’s Mirror]** if used on oneself with unresolved guilt or high despair.

---

### 🎭 *\[Duality]*

> *“Every truth is also a lie. Every love, a longing.”*

* **Tags:** Paradox, opposites, masked selves, transitions
* **Usage:** Often used by performers, Sokowe duelists, or paradox cults as a lens for transformation
* **Mechanics:**

  * May **store two egregors** within a single vessel — switching resonance once per day.
  * Duality-bonded beings can temporarily gain a second emotional resistance (e.g., to Fear *and* Charm).
* **Risks:** High corruption risk; prolonged use may cause **Emotional Paradox** condition or dual inversion.

---

### 🪶 *\[Flow]*

> *“To resist is to fracture. To move is to survive.”*

* **Tags:** Adaptation, flexibility, change
* **Usage:** Core to Ribbon Duelist Sokowe — channels egregoric emotion into motion and reaction
* **Mechanics:**

  * Grants +2 to AC while moving at least 10 feet per turn.
  * Allows **emotional redirection** — once per day, turn \[Rage] into \[Persistence] or \[Despair] into \[Reflection] (DC 15 Charisma).
* **Risks:** Flow becomes chaotic in Longing Zones, potentially triggering inversion into **\[Spasm]** or **\[Fracture]**.

## 📐 **MECHANICAL SYSTEMS THAT IMPACT NEUTRAL EGREGORS**

These egregors respond to the surrounding metaphysical and mechanical systems:

---

### 💔 **Despair Score** \[Despair System Document]

* Neutral egregors can invert **faster than positive egregors** once Despair Score reaches 6+.
* At Score 10+, all neutral egregors become “unstable” and roll on the **Egregor Instability Table** each long rest.

---

### 🧠 **Egregor Instability Score (EIS)** \[📘Codex Egregora Vol. II]

* Tracks how close an egregor is to inversion or evolution.
* At EIS 7+, neutral egregors become “paradox-primed”, meaning they can spawn **paradox egregors** under certain psychic triggers.

---

### 🧪 **Philosopher's Stone Protocol** \[🧪 Document]

* **Stone of Divine Equilibrium** requires **\[Balance] + \[Hope] + \[Memory] + \[Love]** to suppress despair storms.
* Neutral egregors used in formulas risk polarity locking: if the ritual is interrupted, they may **invert permanently**.

---

### 🌒 **Apotheosis Protocol** \[📜 Document]

* Tier 2/3 ritual forcibly inverts one neutral egregor of the caster’s choice upon completion.
* Even high-Egregor Score neutral egregors are vulnerable here unless protected by **Heartfire Communion**.

---

### 🧬 **Maternal Catalyst System** \[💠 Document]

* Neutral egregors passed through maternal lineage often emerge in **Paradox-Born** forms in the child.
* Example: A mother bearing \[Memory] may birth a child with \[Forget-Me-Not] or \[Reversion].

---

### 🔮 **Vizardika Mirror Rites & Emotional Code Cracking** \[Initiation & Counter-Ritual System]

* Using a **Rite of the Mirror Veil** on a neutral egregor may "solidify" its polarity toward control or compassion depending on ritual tone.
* Mirrorlight affects how neutral egregors **reveal themselves** — they flicker between form-states under the gaze.
