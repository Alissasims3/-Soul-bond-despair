## 🔖 🔷 Egregor Categories (Expanded Taxonomy)

| Category         | Definition                                                                                                               | Alignment/Intent           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Positive**     | Egregors tied to constructive, healing, or connective emotions.                                                          | Pure / Resonant            |
| **Negative**     | Egregors tied to corruption, despair, control, and egoistic emotion.                                                     | Hollow / Inverted          |
| **Corrupted**    | Egregors that were once positive, but have been twisted or inverted by Xevir.                                            | Mixed (inverted over time) |
| **Paradox-Born** | Egregors that arise from conflicting truths or contradictory emotional states.                                           | Unstable / Situational     |
| **Dual**         | Egregors that exist as both protective and dangerous depending on the wielder’s motive.                                  | Depends on usage           |
| **Unique**       | Singular egregors that appear only once in the world (e.g., Solar Bond, False Apotheosis).                               | N/A (Divine Exception)     |
| **Neutral**      | Egregors that **do not inherently support or oppose Xevir**, but have **power through balance, clarity, or transition**. | **Equilibrium**            |

## 🔷 Examples of **Neutral Egregors**

Neutral egregors often serve as **emotional stabilizers, observers, or transitional frequencies**. They can be dangerous if destabilized—or sacred if preserved.

| Egregor Name     | Tags                                | Behavior                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **\[Memory]**    | #clarity, #persistence, #resonance  | Helps resist mind-altering magic, maintains identity under pressure. |
| **\[Duty]**      | #order, #devotion, #constraint      | Binds individuals to a role or promise—can be noble or burdensome.   |
| **\[Isolation]** | #protection, #detachment, #selfhood | Can defend against Xevir but also hinder healing.                    |
| **\[Balance]**   | #equilibrium, #stasis, #adaptation  | Neither gives nor takes—used by druids or monks of the Codex Sway.   |
| **\[Curiosity]** | #inquiry, #adaptability, #discovery | Can lead to discovery or to forbidden truths, often used by seers.   |
| **\[Challenge]** | #rivalry, #struggle, #growth        | Drives combat or debate, fostering personal evolution.               |

These egregors may interact differently with Despair Scores. For example:

* **\[Memory]** **buffers** against Despair increase.
* **\[Curiosity]** may **trigger a Paradox-Born Egregor** if combined with trauma.
* **\[Duty]** might **invert into Fanaticism** under Despair 10+.

## ⚖️ How Neutral Egregors Interact with the System

| Mechanic                      | Neutral Behavior                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Despair Score Interaction** | Most neutral egregors **delay mutation onset**, especially \[Memory], \[Duty], \[Balance].                  |
| **Initiation Rituals**        | Can be bonded through either **pure or dual-initiation** rites. May not reduce Despair but stabilize it.    |
| **Egregor Shards**            | Produce **gray shards**—they are rarely used offensively but are **crucial for support or crafting**.       |
| **Philosopher’s Stones**      | Several require neutral egregors: e.g., the **Stone of Divine Equilibrium** uses \[Memory].                 |
| **Rituals & Items**           | Used as **keys or anchors** in counter-rituals or to resist inversion.                                      |
| **Player & NPC Use**          | These are ideal for scholars, monks, archivists, and guardians resisting but not confronting Xevir head-on. |
