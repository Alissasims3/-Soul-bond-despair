---

## 🎨 Appearance & Personality

- **Physical Description:** Tall and lithe, with fiery red hair cascading in careful waves. Piercing green eyes miss little. Her traveling leathers are functional yet fitted, worn but well cared for. Her movements are like smoke — never still, never loud. Her hood almost always shadows her face.
- **Demeanor:** Quiet, calculated, and watchful. Her smirks say more than her words. Often lingering in corners or eavesdropping under the guise of indifference.
- **Personality Traits:** Charismatic when she chooses, deeply observant, always watching for leverage.
- **Flaws:** Emotionally guarded. Suffers from loyalty guilt. Cannot let go of vengeance.
- **Bonds:** Captain X’sa — though she denies her feelings, she watches his back like no one else.  
- **Ideal:** “Information is currency. Trust is a gamble. Revenge is purpose.”
---

## 📜 Lore & Background

- **Noble Blood:** Born a noble’s daughter, Lola fled after her family betrayed her to powerful agents of Xevir. 
- **Scandal and Rebirth:** Disappeared for years — only to reemerge as a ruthless operator. Her name is now whispered in underground circles from the Western Marches to the Sunken Veldt.
- **The Scourge Collector:** She targets the rich and corrupt, known for leaving cryptic notes or coins marked with thorn sigils on her victims.
- **Knowledge Broker:** She holds dangerous truths about Xevir — notably, that it recycles souls and memories through corrupted bloodlines.
- **Spy Within the Caravan:** Captain X’sa relies on her to monitor internal threats and relay information from distant cities and camps. She is often “gone for weeks,” then returns without warning.
- **Secret Motivation:** She hunts one of Xevir’s mortal avatars — a “Benefactor” who once tried to kill her. She does not yet know their true identity.
---

## 💔 Relationships & Drama

- **Captain Rigadzz X’sa:** She is emotionally tied to him but would never admit it. Sees him as broken but worth guarding. Her loyalty may crack if she discovers betrayal — or if he dies.
- **Ziliyandrey De Luticia:** They exchange secrets frequently. Ziliyandrey flirts; Lola never flinches.
- **Leopold Mix:** Calls him “Tea King” — secretly likes his company but acts aloof.
- **The Party:** Tests them constantly. Shares information only after payment or if emotionally struck. If one of them shows her unexpected kindness, she may begin to trust — dangerously.
