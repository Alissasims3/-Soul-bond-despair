- **Seraphine** (Mother)
- **Mira** (Daughter)
- **Race:** Human
- **Faction:** Hidden followers of **Xevir**, the God of Longing

---

### 🧬 Appearance

- **Seraphine:** Gaunt, hollow-eyed, draped in dark, threadbare robes. Moves with eerie serenity.
- **Mira:** Pale child with a crude wooden leg, missing her right limb. Always watching. Rarely speaks. Occasionally hums… oddly dissonant tunes.

---

### 💭 Personality & Demeanor

- **Seraphine:** Soft-spoken, unnervingly calm. Her words carry unsettling finality.
- **Mira:** Silent, hauntingly perceptive. Never cries. Her gaze lingers too long.
- **Presence:** They never speak of Xevir aloud—but their glances, whispers, and passive influence leave a **psychic shadow** wherever they go.

---

### 🕳️ Hidden Backstory

- Seraphine was once a healer until her village was slaughtered. In the ashes, she found **clarity** in Xevir’s entropy.
- Mira lost her leg in that same event. Seraphine believes it was not a tragedy—but a **marking**.
- Their bond is unbreakable, their grief sublimated into quiet devotion.

### 🎯 Motivation

- **Subversion, not conversion.**  
    They are **seed-planters**, not preachers. Their mission is to let doubt grow like mold—unseen until it consumes.
- **Mira is rumored to be “touched”**—some say she can see things others can’t.

# 🕯️Seraphine & Mira within the Caravan

> _“We don’t preach. We wait. The silence always makes them listen.”_

## 👁️ Role in the Caravan

Seraphine and her daughter Mira are **unofficial spiritual figures** traveling quietly within the caravan. While not recognized as part of the leadership, they are **trusted healers by some**, and **deeply unsettling to others**. Their presence is tolerated by Captain X’sa because they follow orders, provide aid… and never cause direct trouble. But many sense something is _off_.

- **Public Role:** Aid-givers, watchers, soft counselors in the night.
- **Secret Role:** **Subtle infiltrators** for **Xevir’s influence**, planting doubt, emotional weakness, and fatal curiosity.
- **Known By:** The zealot pair is mostly left alone. Some guards avoid them entirely. The **fanatic healer Brother Halvard** and **Prophet Malk** share _unspoken nods_ when passing them.

---

## 📜 Behavior in the Caravan

- **Seraphine** walks the outer rings of camp, especially at night. She often appears where grief lingers.
- **Mira** sits near the dead or wounded, sometimes humming lullabies that **mirror long-forgotten prayers to Xevir**.
- They **attend every burial**, saying nothing, but always watching.
- **No one has ever seen them sleep.**

---

## 🔥 Narrative Use in the Caravan

These zealots are **slow-burn threats**, ideal for tension-building or philosophical dread:

- **Whisperers:** Seraphine speaks gently to those losing hope. She always finds the weak spots.
- **Seed Planters:** Mira leaves _drawings in ash_ or _fungal blooms_ where future calamity occurs.
- **Memory Distortion:** PCs may experience **warped dreams** or emotional echoes after extended time around them.
- **Conflict Sparkers:** When leadership falters or food runs short, Seraphine may stir doubts:  
    _“Maybe the gods abandoned you because you clung too tightly to the wrong ones.”_

## 🧩 Hidden Facts (GM Knowledge Only)

- Mira is **partially touched by Xevir**, not yet Sporekind, but _drifting toward it_. She does not dream—**she _remembers_ what others forget**.
- Seraphine **once served in Naivara’s faith**, making her betrayal sting especially hard to devout followers.
- They have **secret symbols etched into the underside of their wagon**, invisible to the uncorrupted.
