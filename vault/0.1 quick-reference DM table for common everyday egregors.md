This covers 20 key egregors, each of which could show up in NPCs, PCs, or entire communities.
If you like, I can **add mechanical hooks** for each one (Egregor Score effect, Despair Score trigger, corruption pathway) so it links directly into your egregor mechanics without needing to look them up.

Do you want me to make that mechanical expansion next?
