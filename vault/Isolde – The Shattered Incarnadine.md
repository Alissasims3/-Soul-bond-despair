## üìú **III. Origin & Core Lore**

### üìú Lore & Origin
- **Origin Story:** Isolde is the daughter of Zenfir Aldershadow and the niece of Xevir. She was a sacred, unwitting pawn in Xevir's grand design. Her mind rewrote her own memories in a desperate, futile attempt to protect itself from Xevir's psychic violation. This act of self-defense set the stage for an era of stolen love and illusion.
- **True Nature:** Isolde is a walking paradox. She is a woman who has forgotten the love she once had, but her soul still carries the echo of it. She is a vessel for The Crawling Choir, a cosmic entity that rises as the primary opposition to the Purity Cult. She is not a person so much as she is a living, walking enigma of a forgotten truth.
- **Goals:** Her goals are unknown to her, as her memories are a lie. She unknowingly communicates with Xevir through a cursed mirror, which serves as a window into a past she has forgotten. Her immediate objective is to survive, and to find the fragments of her true self.
- **Background Details:** Her ritual on her 16th birthday was the true birth-pangs of Longing's Dominion. During the ritual, Xevir manipulated her, planting her unborn child as the perfect vessel for his new beginning, mirroring his own violent "birth".
- **Current Situation:** Isolde is currently enthralled and manipulated by Xevir. She unknowingly communicates with him through a cursed mirror. She is a central, tragic figure, a living mystery to the players who must find the truth of what happened to her.
