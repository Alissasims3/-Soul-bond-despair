## üíé KNOWN DUAL EGREGORS

---

### üî•‚ù§Ô∏è *\[Solar Bond]*

> *‚ÄúBorn from \[Sacrifice], tempered by \[Love], fueled by \[Rage Redirected].‚Äù*

* **Tags:** Divine loyalty, protective fury, transcendent love
* **Origin Egregors:** \[Sacrifice] + \[Love] + \[Rage (redirected)]
* **Mechanics:**

  * Allies within 30 ft of the bearer gain resistance to Fear, Despair-based effects, and psychic damage.
  * Bearer can **redirect a failed death saving throw once per long rest** if near a bonded target.
* **Formation:** Emerged from the pact of Sol-ptica, Aisyle Flameborn, and Skarn Bloodfang.
* **Purification:** Cannot be corrupted ‚Äî acts as a **despair firewall** unless bearer willingly forsakes one origin egregor.
* **Special:** Enables the **Royal Signal** in Sporekind transformation. Required to stabilize **Apotheosis Protocol**.

---

### üíÄüå∏ *\[False Apotheosis]*

> *‚ÄúTranscendence that feeds the void.‚Äù*

* **Tags:** Corrupted divinity, ego rebirth, despair elevation
* **Origin Egregors:** \[Obsession] + \[Perversion] + \[Despair] (through ritual synthesis)
* **Mechanics:**

  * Grants user divine features (resistance, charm aura), but increases Despair Score every 24 hours.
  * User radiates a **corruption field**, inverting nearby weak egregors automatically at EIS 8+.
* **Creation:** Used in the **Apotheosis Protocol** via the **Stone of False Transcendence**.
* **Interaction:** Must be severed with paradox-born egregors (\[Sacrifice for One], \[Forgiveness], \[Fragmented Truth]) or via divine interference.
* **Special:** Leaves a **divine scar** on soul ‚Äî detectable by gods and egregor-bonded seers.

---

### üîÆüî• *\[Devoted Wrath]*

> *‚ÄúI love you enough to kill for you.‚Äù*

* **Tags:** Guardian rage, holy fury, burning devotion
* **Origin Egregors:** \[Love] + \[Rage]
* **Mechanics:**

  * Bearer gains **+2 to attack and damage** when defending their bonded target.
  * While active, bearer may ignore the frightened condition and charm effects.
* **Formation:** Common in divine warrior-pacts, especially among Solar Knights, Emberbound, and family-based cult orders.
* **Purification:** May invert to \[Obsession] + \[Rage] if love becomes possessive.

---

### üåäüî• *\[Calm Fury]*

> *‚ÄúThe sea burns quietly.‚Äù*

* **Tags:** Controlled anger, emotional suppression, meditation-as-weapon
* **Origin Egregors:** \[Rage] + \[Balance]
* **Mechanics:**

  * Bearer can choose to **delay rage-triggered effects** until their choosing, then **detonate all at once** (psychic backlash within 15 ft).
  * May spend a reaction to **absorb emotional outbursts** from others (negate Egregor Echoes).
* **Usage:** Favored by trauma-forged monks, empathic warriors, and ‚Äúkeepers of silence‚Äù.
* **Purification:** If Despair Score reaches 10, egregor **shatters into \[Numbness] + \[Rebellion]** unless stabilized.

---

### ü™∂‚öîÔ∏è *\[Noble Defiance]*

> *‚ÄúBound by oath. Unbound in spirit.‚Äù*

* **Tags:** Loyal opposition, respectful resistance, free oathkeeping
* **Origin Egregors:** \[Duty] + \[Freedom]
* **Mechanics:**

  * Grants bearer the ability to **defy a sworn order** without breaking their oath.
  * Once per day, bearer can declare **Rite of Refusal**: gain advantage on rolls resisting control or obedience egregors.
* **Formation:** Emerges in characters who **reject authority for moral reasons** but remain bound to their cause.
* **Purification:** Stable but brittle. If one egregor fails, the other becomes dominant and may invert.

### üî∑ Dual Egregor Activation Mechanics

| Mechanic                         | Effect                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Daily Dawn Choice**            | Bearer chooses dominant polarity (one egregor active for the day, the other passive) |
| **Fracture Point (Despair ‚â• 8)** | Dual egregor **may split**; DM rolls d6:                                             |

* 1‚Äì2: Inverts both egregors
* 3‚Äì4: Shatters one, the other persists
* 5‚Äì6: Temporarily transforms into Paradox-Born variant
  \| **Mirrorlight Effect** | Dual egregors shimmer in both spectra. Under intense reflection, they may **reveal hidden bonds** or past life emotional echoes.

### üß† Emotional Surge Reactions (Volatility Table)

During intense emotional events (e.g., seeing bonded ally die, surviving death save at 0 HP, divine possession):

| Roll (d6) | Result                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | Egregor Shatters (DM choice)                            |
| 2‚Äì3       | Inversion Surge (Despair +2)                            |
| 4         | Bond Echo (replay a past egregor memory)                |
| 5         | Dual Polarity Swap (secondary egregor becomes dominant) |
| 6         | Temporary Apotheosis (1 min divine aura effect)         |

### üìö Vizardika Integration

* Dual egregors are **‚ÄúRitual-Sensitive Entities‚Äù**.
* Advanced Vizardika rites may **stabilize**, **split**, or **elevate** a dual egregor into a **Unique** form.
* Requires **Dual Core Threads** woven into a ritual grid, sometimes with emotional self-offering.

Would you like to proceed to:

* **Unique Egregors** (e.g., \[The Thread Between], \[The Fire Kept Burning], \[The Gentle Collector])
* Generate **Codex entries** for any Dual egregor
* Or begin creating **custom dual egregors** from player emotion states or story arcs?

You can also request a **Dual Egregor Generator Template** for emergent narrative moments.
