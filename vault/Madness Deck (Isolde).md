## ✅ Tips for Use

* **Fast Rolling:** Roll `1d6` for category → roll within that group.
* **Keep It Fluid:** If a particular vision fits the scene, skip rolling and just choose.
* **DM Fiat:** Modify effects for pacing—e.g., Despair Points, fear, Insight checks, or temporary buffs/debuffs.
* **Repeat Visions:** If needed, let visions repeat or evolve slightly (e.g., the same scene seen from a new angle or with new sensory detail).

- On a **natural 1** on any d20 roll (as per her _Madness Lurks_ trait).
- On a failed Wisdom saving throw against fear, madness, or psychic damage.
- Narratively, when encountering a person, place, object of immense psychic resonance or Entering high-resonance zones (e.g., \[🩸 Ritual Site], \[🌕 Mirror of Fronto]).

3.  **The Shattered Hope:** *You witness the fall of a great sorcerer robed in flame (Malzarius). As Xevir's blade strikes him down, the sorcerer's body doesn't bleed—it shatters into a thousand tiny embers that scatter on the wind, each one a flickering spark of defiance.*

**Tag:** `#Malzarius #hope #sacrifice`


### 🩸 Isolde’s True Ritual
> Your younger self strapped to a cold altar. Xevir surgically extracts a child...

4.  **Isolde's True Ritual:** *You see a younger version of yourself, not in a loving embrace, but strapped to a cold, black altar. Xevir stands over you, his face a mask of profound sorrow. He isn't trying to possess you; he's carefully, surgically, extracting a tiny, crying infant from your womb. "I will protect you from this world," he whispers to the child.* 

**Effect:** DC 15 WIS save or become stunned 1 round.  
**Tag:** `#ritual #trauma #child`

> Domestic glimpses meant to confuse her hatred for Xevir.
> Tags: `#Reigna #complication #domestic #longing`

### 🪞 Regina’s Hair
> Xevir brushes the hair of a young girl in front of a grand mirror. She looks like you.

1.  **Regina's Hair:** *You see Xevir from behind, standing in a quiet, ornate room. He is gently brushing the long, silver-black hair of a young girl who is sitting before a grand mirror. She looks almost exactly like you did at that age. He is humming a soft, sad lullaby. The girl turns, and her eyes are his.*

**Effect:** DC 14 Insight or become charmed by Xevir for 1 minute.  
**Tag:** `#Reigna #fatherfigure`

### 🧸 The Broken Toy
> The girl runs to him with a broken wooden bird. He fixes it tenderly.

2.  **The Broken Toy:** *The same young girl (Regina) runs to Xevir, crying, holding a beautifully crafted wooden bird with a snapped wing. Xevir kneels, taking it with impossible tenderness. He whispers a word, and a thread of golden light stitches the wing back together. He hands it back to her, his expression one of paternal softness that you have never seen.*

**Effect:** Disadvantage on next INT-based skill check. Memory becomes "soft."  
**Tag:** `#symbolism #paternal`

### 🌸 A Father’s Lesson
> "Beautiful things break." A crystalline garden. He teaches serenity.

1.  **A Father's Lesson:** *Xevir and the young girl are walking through a garden of crystalline flowers. He points to one. "They are beautiful because they are fragile," he says. "Our purpose is to build a world where nothing beautiful ever has to break again." The girl looks at him with pure adoration.*

**Effect:** +1 to next Persuasion check, but disadvantage on next Wisdom save.

> Tags: `#CrawlingChoir #eldritch #psychictrauma`

### 🎶 The Crawling Song
> The world is singing mouths; you are a note in the song.

1.  *Reality peels back, and you see the truth: the world is a tapestry of singing, screaming mouths, each one a different note in a song that devours sanity. The Choir is not whispering to you; you are a note in its song.*

**Effect:** Roll on Short-Term Madness Table (DMG p.259)  
**Tag:** `#song #eldritchidentity`



### 🪞 The Face in the Mirror
> You glance at a reflective surface. Your face is a vortex of eyes and teeth.

2.  *You glance at a reflective surface—a puddle, a polished shield—and for a fraction of a second, your own face is gone, replaced by a swirling vortex of eyes and teeth. You feel a sudden, uncontrollable urge to laugh.*

**Effect:** You burst into laughter; next enemy has advantage to hit you.  
**Tag:** `#mirrors #laughter #unstable`

### 🌑 The Silent City
> A city stares at the sky. Black rain melts faces like wax.

3. *You are standing in the City of Black Obedience, but it's utterly silent. The citizens are all looking up at the sky, their faces blank, as a slow, black rain begins to fall. Where it touches their skin, their features melt away like wax.*
   
**Effect:** You gain vulnerability to psychic damage for 1 hour.  
**Tag:** `#obedience #purity #visions`


### 🌼 The True Opposite
> A sterile acolyte screams as a flower grows from their chest. The Choir laughs.

4.  *You see a perfectly sterile, white room. In the center is a member of the Cult of Sacred Purity, praying. Suddenly, a single, vibrant, chaotic flower sprouts from their chest, and they scream in agony as its beautiful, impossible colors corrupt their perfect form. The Choir laughs.*
   
**Effect:** You are immune to fear until end of next encounter. Then gain 1 Despair.  
**Tag:** `#purity #opposition #symbiosis`


## 🕯️ Category 5: **The Soul Harvest (Horrors of Devotion & Defiance)**

>*(These visions are cold, intimate, and deeply disturbing. They focus on the metaphysical consumption that fuels Xevir's power, stripping away any pretense of benevolent godhood.)* 
> Horrors of devotion, defiance, and the consumption of identity.
> Tags: `#souls #devotion #sacrifice #Xevir`

### 🔮 Willing Sacrifice


#### ✨ The Ecstatic Offering
> A woman dies smiling as Xevir inhales her soul.

1.  *You see a grand, cathedral-like hall. Hundreds of Xevir's followers are kneeling, their faces upturned in rapturous joy. Xevir, looking serene and benevolent, walks among them. He gently touches a woman's forehead. Her body goes limp, a peaceful smile on her face, as a shimmering thread of silver-blue light—her soul—is drawn from her mouth and nose. Xevir inhales it gently, like the scent of a flower, and his eyes glow with a soft, satisfied light. The body left behind is an empty, placid husk.*

**Effect:** DC 13 WIS save or become charmed by Xevir for 1 minute.  
**Tag:** `#offering #consumption #joy`



#### 🎼 The Final Hymn
> A dying man speaks his last: "My longing is enough." A tendril takes his soul.

2.  *You are in a darkened room, filled with the sound of a beautiful, whispered hymn. An old man lies on a simple cot, surrounded by his family. "He is coming for me," the old man whispers, his voice filled not with fear, but with pride. "My longing is finally enough." As he breathes his last, a shadowy tendril snakes from the corner of the room, pierces his chest without leaving a mark, and retracts, pulling his soul with it. The family weeps tears of joy for his divine ascent.*
   
**Effect:** Disadvantage on Insight checks for 1 hour.  
**Tag:** `#hymn #peacefuldeath`


#### 🔥 The Collective Tithe
> Across the world, priests slice off pieces of soul. Fireflies fly toward a tower.

3. *A flash of a thousand faces, all at once. They are Xevir's priests and priestesses across the land. At a coordinated moment, they all begin to chant. As they do, you see them willingly sever a small piece of their own soul—a painful, but ecstatic act of self-mutilation—and offer it up. The fragments of light fly through the air like fireflies, all converging on a single, distant, dark tower.*

**Effect:** Spell Save DC –1 for 1d4 hours. Psychic spells may backlash.  
**Tag:** `#ritual #massworship #tithe`


### 🧊 The Haunted Unwilling

#### 🧊 The Soul Cages
> Defiant souls re-live regret eternally, powering their own prison.

4.  **The Soul Cages:** *You are in a vast, misty chamber that feels like it's outside of time and space. Thousands of souls, those who defied Xevir or whose longing was not "pure" enough, are trapped in crystalline cages. They don't scream; they are forced to eternally re-live the single moment of their greatest regret, their sorrow and despair feeding the very structure of their prison. You see a defiant warrior, a hero who fought against him, now weeping endlessly over a childhood mistake.*

**Effect:** DC 15 WIS save or become frightened of failure.  
**Tag:** `#regret #futility #eternity`

#### 🌀 The Echo of Defiance
> A woman sees Xevir’s face in every memory. Her past becomes a lie.

4.  **The Echo of Defiance:** *You see the soul of a woman who refused to worship him. She is not caged, but she is haunted. Everywhere she turns in the ethereal plane, she sees Xevir's face in the crowds. Every memory she tries to cling to is subtly twisted—the face of her husband is now his, the voice of her child now whispers his dogma. Her own mind has become her eternal tormentor, a prison of longing she can never escape.*

**Effect:** Any memory check requires Insight DC 14 to avoid false belief.  
**Tag:** `#gaslight #haunting #mindprison`

#### 🧵 The Unraveled Man
> Xevir slowly unravels a soul, thread by thread, consuming memory and skill.

4.  **The Unraveled Man:** *A horrifying, visceral flash: you see a single, translucent soul of a powerful mage who fought Xevir to the end. Xevir is there, not attacking it, but gently, methodically, pulling it apart thread by thread. With each thread he unravels, a cherished memory is erased, a skill is forgotten, a piece of the mage's identity is consumed and repurposed. The soul's silent scream of dissolution is the most terrifying thing you have ever witnessed.*

**Effect:** Roll d6:

| d6 | Effect |
|----|--------|
| 1 | Disadvantage on INT checks (memory fade) |
| 2 | Wisdom save DC 13 or laughter for 1 round when casting |
| 3 | Next spell deals 1d6 psychic damage to Isolde |
| 4 | +1 Despair Score and vulnerability to charm |
| 5 | Lose access to 1 spell until long rest |
| 6 | +2 to one skill, but success costs 1 Despair |

**Tag:** `#memoryloss #identity #consumption`

### 🗝️ Optional Whisper Table

Tag: `#choirwhispers`

Roll or choose:

* “It’s not real, but you are.”
* “Don’t resist the song. Sing your note.”
* “What you’ve forgotten is better than what you’ll remember.”

## ✅ DM Tips

* Visions can “leak” into shared dreams if other PCs touch Isolde or fail similar saves.
* Aisyle or Skarn may recognize elements from their own suppressed pasts.
* Over time, group visions can hint at interlinked karmic arcs.
