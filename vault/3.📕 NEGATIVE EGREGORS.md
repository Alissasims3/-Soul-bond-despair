### 🕳️ *\[Despair]*

* **Tags:** Domination, obsession, possession, tethering
* **Mechanics:**

  * Can be used to **mentally override** lesser egregor bonds (DC 16 Charisma save).

---

### 🔥 *\[Obsession]*

* **Tags:** Addiction, fixation, emotional recursion
* **Mechanics:**

* **Despair Score Trigger:** +2 upon betrayal or obsession-loss triggers.

---

### 🕸️ *\[Perversion]*

> *“It still looks like love, if you squint.”*

* **Tags:** Twisted affection, boundary erasure, emotional exploitation
* **Mechanics:**

  * Can **mimic** \[Love], \[Compassion], or \[Sacrifice] to avoid detection by non-initiate Vizardika seers.
  * On reveal, causes target to suffer **2d10 psychic damage** and roll a Despair Save.
* **Interactions:**

  * Used in **False Apotheosis Protocols** and **Mirror Veil cults**.
  * Can **embed Xeviric Brands** into a bonded soul without their knowledge.
* **Despair Score Trigger:** +1 per day for the bearer, +1 per bond deceived.

### 🫥 *\[Denial]*

> *“There was never a wound. Only silence.”*

* **Tags:** Suppression, rejection, avoidance

* Requires **Mirrorlight Detection** or Vizardika attunement to notice.
* Cleansing may involve **Heartfire Communion**, **True Naming**, or a **Forgiveness Rite**.
