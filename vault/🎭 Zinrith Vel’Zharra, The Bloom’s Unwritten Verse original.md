## 🎨 II. Appearance & Personality

### 🎨 Appearance & Personality

* **Physical Description:**
  Moonlight-blue skin that shimmers softly under starlight. One eye always veiled behind obsidian chain or fungus-silk. Her tattoos are ever-shifting runes, visible only when willed. During combat or strong emotion, black shimmering veins ripple across her flesh. Her attire is woven from midnight lace and Sporeshade silk, laced with hidden blades and memory crystal compartments.

* **Demeanor:**
  Cold grace with sudden vulnerability. Walks like music, strikes like regret. Her presence unravels expectations—she makes others feel simultaneously seen and forgotten. Sometimes harmonizes with a voice not her own.

* **Personality:**
  Composed, poetic, methodical, haunted by her own memory. Loyal to no one, but anchored by unresolved grief. Art and murder are one and the same to her. A blade of purpose seeking shape.

* **Personality Expansion:**
  Zinrith’s identity fracture manifests in quiet ways—hesitating before finishing a kill, staring into mirrors too long, or whispering in the tongue of the Hive unconsciously. Her emotions were censored by Hive design, but they leak out through her body’s mutations and her growing rebellion.

* **Divine Emotion / Egregor Association:**

  * **Primary Egregor:** \[Memory as Wound]
  * Secondary: \[Isolation], \[Performance], \[Vengeance Through Beauty]

## 📜 III. Lore & Origin

### 📜 Lore & Origin

* **Origin Story:**
  Born into a cult that revered dance, death, and memory as one divine trinity. Zinrith was groomed as an Archive-Dancer—each performance sealed a memory, each kill recorded as poetry in flesh. After her twin sister was executed for disobedience, Zinrith’s grief triggered a forbidden spore mutation: the **Veins of the Void**. The Hive Father branded her an anomaly but spared her—for she remembered too perfectly.

  The Queen of Blades found Zinrith in a dream, whispering rebellion into her blood. The Hive’s archivist became its most unstable element.

* **True Nature:**
  She is a **Living Egregoric Key**—the fusion of memory, mutation, and mourning. She is the archive the Hive cannot delete and the bloom it cannot prune. Her dance is both ritual and virus.

* **Goals:**

  * Avenge her sister
  * Sever or master her bond to the Hive
  * Decipher the **Blooming Vault**
  * Decide if she is meant to free the Hive or shatter it completely

* **Background Details:**

  * Betrayed by a noble merchant family
  * Was partially consumed by a Vault entity during her induction
  * Has seen glimpses of a future where she becomes the *Mirror-Queen*—an avatar of synthetic memory
  * May unknowingly host one of the Queen of Blades' original memories

* **Current Situation:**
  In the company of the party, though her motives remain veiled. She seeks old sites of memory—the Ain’t Tree, Vaults, and Fractal Bloom relics. Sporekind watchers report her behavior back to the Hive Father. The Queen of Blades may soon demand more direct control.
