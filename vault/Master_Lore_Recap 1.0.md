# 🌍 [[🌍 World_of_Xevir — Index|WORLD OF XEViR]] – Master Recap: The Dark Dominion of Xevir

---

## 🧠 CORE THEME

A #post-apocalyptic, #dark_fantasy world where despair births gods, memories shape reality, and #identity itself is a fragile weapon. The catastrophic **[[01_Characters/BBEG/The Cosmic Drowning]]** fractured reality, unleashing eldritch creatures and corrupting the land. Six months ago, the **[[First Coming]]** tore open the veil between realms; the old gods are dead, hiding, corrupted… or replaced by what mortals have made in their absence.

## 👑 [[🩸Xevir_The_God_of_Longing|Xevir]]-L0√e3003S (“Xevir/X”) – The God of Longing

- **Nature:** Alien entity become deeply human and tragic.
- **Origin:** Born from collective mortal despair; he longs for connection but knows only control.
- **Mask:** Reflects your deepest desire; currently wears Anatar’s former face (possibly Isolde’s lost lover).
- **Influence:** Responsible for/connected to:
    - #The_City_of_Black_Obedience (the capital, where he feeds on minds and souls)
    - #The_First_Coming
    - #Corruption_o_dreams, emotions, and memories

- **Curse:** Xevir’s **skin is paper-thin**, fragile like a decaying #husk. He wears **black armor** that grants powerful resistances, but it’s temporary—he cannot wear it forever.
- **Immortality?** He is worshipped as a god through sacrificial rituals, but he is not truly immortal.

---

## 🕳️ THE STATE OF THE WORLD

- **The #Sun is called the [[Fallen Moon]];** it shines only for a few hours each day. Despite this, the land is unbearably hot, with **lava seeping from the earth**.
- **Emotion is dying.** People in the capital are brainwashed, forever yearning for their #Dark_Majesty. The further from the city, the weaker his influence.
- **Love is forbidden.** Any deep connection is rebellious—except #devotion to Xevir, which is #ritualistic, twisted, and akin to addiction.

---

## 🕯️ THE REBELLION & FACTIONS

- **The Rebellion ("[[Freewilliam’s Call]]"):** Hidden beyond the **[[🌽 Serenity Cornfields]]**, the last bastion of resistance survives. Their leader, **[[🐺Freeewiliam_Losterth]]**, is a powerful warrior and #symbol of hope.
- **[[The High Priests of X]]:** #Fanatics #worshippers who run shrines and sacrificial rituals, feeding #Xevir with the devotion and minds of the populace.

---

## 🗝️ KEY LOCATIONS

- **[[📚_Library_of_the_Mind|Library of the Mind]]:** A lost repository of #knowledge, #metaphysical #dream-realm of thought and memory. Accessed via #lucid dreaming, ritual, or with the help of [[🧠Fronto_the_Paranoid_Hag|Fronto]]. Holds the #secret of Xevir’s curse and the true **[[🌕 Ritual_of_the_Blue_Moon|Blue Moon Ritual]]**.
- **[[🌀 Labyrinth_of_1000_Eyes|Labyrinth of 1,000 Eyes]]:** A nightmarish extradimensional #maze, designed to test those seeking the Library. Each “eye” is a mind Xevir tried to absorb.
- **[[Vault of Forgotten Light:]]** Holds a #divine_spark—pure, uncorrupted emotion or godhood. May be the only way to destroy or #purify Xevir.
- **[[🌽 Serenity Cornfields]]:** Home of #Fronto_the_Mad_Hag, a rare safe zone from Xevir’s influence. Also where #Isolde receives the #mirror of the lost lover.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 IMPORTANT NPCS

- **[[🌀 Vaerith_Sylen’thar]] (#High_Elf_Architect):** Designed the #labyrinth and #Vault. Remains neutral and only intervenes if players prove themselves worthy.
- **[[🔥 Malzarius_the_First_Sun]] (#Shattered_Sorcerer):** Tried to burn Xevir out of existence but was killed. His fragmented soul lingers in the #Vault, guiding (or misleading) those who enter.
- **[[Fronto the Mad Hag]] (Male Hag, Escaped Thrall):** Once a #victim of Xevir, escaped 50 moons ago but suffers ongoing mental instability. He might know where the Vault is but cannot maintain #clarity long enough to reveal it; lives in exile in a giant tree near the #Serenity_Cornfields.

## 🧟 THE TRUTH OF XEViR & [[THE BLUE MOON RITUAL]]

- The **Library of the Mind** holds the secret of his curse. Every **150 moons**, during the **Night of the Blue Moon**, a ritual can be performed to remove his curse. But what happens then?
    - **Does he die?**
    - **Does he become something even worse?**
    - **Was he keeping something else sealed away this whole time?**

## 🧩 SPECIAL THREADS

### Mindflayer Rogue Concept
A rogue with mindflayer traits—a failed experiment or proto-Xevir subject—tied to Xevir’s “memory absorption” projects. May become an NPC guide, a rival, or the first being Xevir couldn’t fully absorb.

### [[💔🔥 Xevir x Isolde|💔🔥 Isolde’s “Be Right Back” Arc]]
Isolde receives a mirror (from Fronto or a fanatic) and sees a lost lover return—warm, gentle, familiar. Over time, she realizes it’s Xevir—they were in love before his transformation. Climax: save him, let him die, or let him consume her in love.
