### 3. Detailed Blueprints for High-Priority Systems

#### Blueprint 1: Despair Score
- Stat (0-20), DM or player tracked
- **Triggers:** Fails vs. psychic/emotional attacks, witnessing horror, exposure to corrupted areas, failing Xevir whisper saves
- **Thresholds:** 
    - 5: Minor madness
    - 10: Major madness/corrupted magic
    - 15: Inverted egregors, Xevir influence
    - 20: Identity erased, enthrallment

#### Blueprint 2: Egregor System
- Point pool (1-20) per emotional domain
- **Gain:** Roleplay, rituals, discoveries
- **Spend:** Boons, advantage, ritual fuel

#### Blueprint 3: Ritual of Vizardika (Pure Initiation)
- Requires knife (transformation), gift (creation), Oath of Resonant Creation
- **Success:** +1 to Egregor, -1d4 Despair, severs Tethered Egregor

### 4. Fixes & Refinements Needed

- **Plot Hole:** Ambiguous Vizardas/Xevir/Naivara relations—need explicit narrative definition (recommend: Cosmic Drowning shattered pantheon, Naivara preserves memory/death)
- **Fix:** Tie all non-Xevir gods to specific narrative functions in post-Drowning order

---

### 5. Improvements & Hooks

- **Improvement:** Formalize "Madness Lurks" deck—draw on failed Xevir saves for temporary/permanent effects
- **Improvement:** Add "Hope Surge" resource—earned by brave acts, spent to resist Despair or reroll corrupted checks
- **Faction Hook:** Purity Cult "Splinter War"—loyalists seek "Sun-Name Scrolls" for original Initiation, corrupted use false scriptures (central political plot)

---

### 6. Unclaimed Hooks List

- [Lore Gap] The Maternal Catalyst: Isolde’s unborn child as "perfect vessel" -> Family Bond Tree system
- [Mechanic Gap] Philosopher’s Stone Protocol: Dangerous ritual, could be expanded
- [Mechanic Gap] Custom Dice System: Emotion-themed dice, resonance/inversion checks (potential standalone RPG)
- [Lore Gap] Vault of the Sporekind: Location with special purpose, contents and encounters unrefined
