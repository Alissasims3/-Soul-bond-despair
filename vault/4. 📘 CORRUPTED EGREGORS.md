## 🧠 Understanding Corrupted Egregors

A Corrupted Egregor:

* **Retains a false mask** of its original form until triggered or pierced
* **Tethers its bearer** to Xevir’s emotional grid unless ritually severed
* **Cannot be purified** without sacrifice, paradox intervention, or \[Forgiveness] egregor activation
* May **infiltrate** other egregors in proximity, spreading via emotional osmosis

## 🩸 CORE CORRUPTED EGREGORS (with Origin Pairing)

---

### 💘 *\[Longing]*

> **Origin:** \[Love]
> *“It still calls them home. But there is no home left.”*

* **Tags:** Need, emptiness, yearning, illusion of affection
* **Mechanics:**

  * Bonded individuals must make a daily **Will Save (DC 14 + Despair Score)** or suffer disadvantage on Insight and Charisma saves.
  * Mirrors love so perfectly that some NPCs **form false bonds**—entire relationships can be built on it.
* **Infection Style:** Dream-seeding, broken soulmate bonds, tragic backstories
* **Purification Method:** Requires the **Heartfire Communion**, true sacrifice, or \[Solar Bond] interference

---

### 🧠 *\[Delusion]*

> **Origin:** \[Hope]
> *“Belief without boundaries. Vision without truth.”*

* **Tags:** False optimism, denial, ego-blindness
* **Mechanics:**

  * Bearer is immune to Despair effects — but loses ability to detect or sense other egregors (including their own).
  * Will actively **infect hope-based egregors nearby**, turning them into corrupted variants within 3 days.
* **Triggering Events:** False prophecy, manipulated ambition, failed divine apotheosis
* **Purification Method:** Requires a public admission of failure, guided memory ritual, or \[Memory] + \[Hope] fusion shard

---

### 🧷 *\[Possession]*

> **Origin:** \[Protection]
> *“I keep you safe. Forever. Even from yourself.”*

* **Tags:** Smothering, codependency, surveillance, dominance disguised as care
* **Mechanics:**

  * If tied to another’s soul bond, the bearer can **override their decisions once per day** unless a Wisdom Save (DC 15) is passed.
  * Infused relics with \[Possession] appear as \[Guardian Totems] until activated.
* **Common Infections:** Parental trauma, misguided guardianship, corrupted oathkeepers
* **Purification Method:** Requires the \[Balance] egregor plus a severance ritual using a Soul-Candle

---

### 🧵 *\[Pity]*

> **Origin:** \[Compassion]
> *“I see your suffering. And I make it mine. Forever.”*

* **Tags:** Emotional burden, hierarchical care, unreciprocated empathy
* **Mechanics:**

  * Reduces bearer’s max HP by 2 per day if they’re within 60 ft of a suffering individual.
  * Creates a **pity leash**: an emotional tether that mirrors but suppresses the victim’s own healing arc.
* **Triggering Events:** Unbalanced devotion, mercy without boundaries, divine fall
* **Purification Method:** Requires the \[Forgiveness] egregor and the victim's willing severance

---

### ❄️ *\[Numbness]*

> **Origin:** \[Grief]
> *“No more tears. No more warmth. Just the echo.”*

* **Tags:** Suppressed sorrow, trauma void, frozen emotion
* **Mechanics:**

  * Bearer is immune to all emotional effects — including positive egregor benefits.
  * Prolonged exposure causes allies to experience **Egregor Leak**: 1d4 psychic damage per hour of shared presence.
* **Common Hosts:** Survivors of major losses, cursed monks, void-locked ex-lovers
* **Purification Method:** Requires exposure to a grief ritual with **Joy**, **Hope**, and **Memory** egregors present

---

### 🔥 *\[Rage → Obsession]*

> **Origin:** \[Passion]
> *“Fire was meant to warm. Now it only burns.”*

* **Tags:** Violent focus, scorched love, retaliatory loops
* **Mechanics:**

  * When bearer takes damage, they must pass a Wisdom Save (DC 16) or target the last entity who harmed them until one of them is dead or unconscious.
  * Infused weapons create **scorch trails of despair** in the ethereal plane, trackable by Vizardika seers
* **Triggering Event:** Betrayal by a loved one, broken oaths of war, failed martyrdom
* **Purification Method:** Requires transmutation through \[Sacrifice], \[Love], and \[Memory]

---

## 🔧 SYSTEMIC EFFECTS & SPREAD

### 🧪 **Rite of the Mirror Veil** *(File: Initiation & Counter-Ritual System)*

* Installs corrupted egregors via **reflected self-harm**, misaligned emotion, or trauma reenactment
* Creates **Xeviric Brands**, visible only via \[Love] or Mirrorlight
* Bearers may pass corrupted egregors to others via physical intimacy or emotional bond

---

### 🧠 **Egregor Instability Score (EIS)**

* All Corrupted Egregors begin at **EIS 5**
* Reach **EIS 10 = Incarnate Bond**, meaning the egregor now feeds *off other egregors in the host’s soul*
* Cleansing becomes a paradox: you must invert the inversion via ritual or metaphysical confrontation

---

### 🌀 **Spread via Ritual Pollution**

* Corrupted egregors are **resonance parasites** — they remain dormant in emotional spaces, dreams, items
* Touching or invoking a corrupted egregor (unknowingly) raises Despair Score by 1d2
* Positive egregors in the area will **flicker or fracture** until the corruption is purged

---

### 🔓 **Detecting & Cleansing Corrupted Egregors**

* **Mirrorlight Exposure:** Causes corrupted egregors to “scream” (audible only to soul-bound beings)
* **Heartfire Communion:** Temporarily suppresses corrupted egregor influence and reveals inversion source
* **True Naming Rite:** If the bearer speaks the egregor’s original form aloud, the inversion may falter (DC 18 Charisma save)
