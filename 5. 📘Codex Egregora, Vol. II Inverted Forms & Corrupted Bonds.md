# 📘 **Codex Egregora, Vol. II: Inverted Forms & Corrupted Bonds**

_“The love remained. But it forgot how to be kind.”_

---

In this tome, we uncover **known corrupted egregors**—twisted manifestations of love, trust, or memory that have been **reprogrammed** by **Xevir** or his cult into **obedience circuits**, **obsession traps**, or **control viruses**.

These aren’t mere feelings gone sour—these are **psychic machines**, warped into **psionic malware** that bind, dominate, or consume.

## 🕯️ Optional Mechanic: **Egregor Instability Score** (EIS)

Track each corrupted egregor’s **instability level** (0–10):

- 1–3 = Flickering (mild effects)
    
- 4–6 = Shifting (psychic bleed begins)
    
- 7–9 = Unstable (manifestation risk)
    
- 10 = **Fracture Event** (corrupted egregor spawns creature, curses the user, or enters combat phase)
    

Players (or enemies) who do not resolve these egregors in time will **spawn corrupted echoes**, draw Xevir’s gaze, or infect nearby NPCs.

- _“You never loved me. You just wanted me safe.”_
    
- _“I would’ve died for you. So why did you leave?”_
    
- _“This isn’t obsession. It’s clarity.”_
    
- _“I still hear you. I don’t think I want it to stop.”_
