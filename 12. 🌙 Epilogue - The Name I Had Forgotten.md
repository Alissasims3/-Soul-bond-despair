# 🌙 **Epilogue: “The Name I Had Forgotten”**

_A quiet room. A heartbeat. The end of a battle—but not of a life._

---

### 📍Setting: Green Church District, Hallows Edge

A soft breeze tickles linen curtains. The haze of late morning filters through vine-covered stained glass. Outside, distant bells toll for the sun—not in worship, but relief.

Aisyle lies in a wide hospital cot, barely rising with each breath. Her arms are wrapped in bandages scorched by plasma. Her side still flickers with faint lines of radiant burn.

At her side:

- **Skarn Bloodfang**, curled upright in a chair, sword still buckled to his hip. One hand dangles. The other clutches the broken crystal that once belonged to the Winter Palace. He snores like a collapsing forge.
    
- Beneath the bed, **Sol-Ptica** is a quiet smolder—its body pulsing in sleep, dreams bubbling out as tiny spores of flame that fade before reaching the ceiling.
    

And then—

**The door opens.**

Soft footsteps. The scent of sage and steam.  
A cane taps the ground once. Then stops.

**Lira enters.**

She carries a ceramic bowl of glowing herbal soup, though her eyes do not look at it. They stare only at the woman in the bed.

For a moment, nothing moves.

Then—

### 💫 Aisyle stirs.

Eyes flutter. Breath hitches.

“…Skarn?” she murmurs, throat dry.

He doesn’t wake.

She groans. Tries to sit. Fails. Her body is heavy, dense with alchemical change.

Then—

**She sees her.**

The woman by the bed.  
Older. Stern. Familiar.  
Her green eye wet with unshed tears.  
The scar that cuts across her face catching the sunlight.

Aisyle’s fingers tremble.

> “You—” she whispers.

Lira does not speak at first. She simply sets down the bowl. Her hands shake as she brushes hair from Aisyle’s sweat-drenched brow.

Then, she kneels.

> **“Forgive me, flameborn.”**  
> “I watched you die… in a fire I helped light. I carved the runes. I brought the blade.”  
> “And yet you survived. Over and over. Even the gods had to respect it.”  
> “I spent sixty years praying you’d never remember.”  
> “And sixty seconds just now… hoping you would.”

A long silence.

Aisyle turns her head, eyes half-glazed. But a single tear runs from her left eye—over the royal blue vein at her temple.

> “What’s my name?” she asks.

Lira closes her eyes. Her voice, small now.

> “Juliana Aisyle Feroliat. Daughter of the High Emberblood.”  
> “You were born in the twin hour. Half for snow. Half for fire.”  
> “They took you from me. From us.”  
> “I gave you up… and I swore never to look back.”

> “But you looked back for me.”

### 🧬 Egregor Update: [Forgiveness] Unlocked

This egregor blooms between them now—a new resonance not born from fire or fury, but the willingness to see what was hidden.

---

### ✨ Closing Vision

In the glass of the window, as Lira sits by her side, Aisyle sees something else. Just for a second:

- A tall woman with blue-gold curls.
    
- A child in her arms.
    
- A forest of flame and snow.
    

She blinks—and it’s gone.

But now… she remembers.

---

## 🌅 Final Words

> Aisyle turns her face to the light.  
> “I’ve died enough,” she whispers.  
> “I think it’s time I lived.”

And from beneath the bed, Sol-Ptica emits one tiny, satisfied puff of golden flame.
