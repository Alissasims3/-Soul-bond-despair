## I. The Core Paradox

The central secret of the campaign is that **Xevir desires his own ascension, not his destruction.** The **Ritual of the Blue Moon** is not a weapon designed to kill him, but a grand piece of theater he has orchestrated to trick the party into becoming the final, willing components in his apotheosis. He is the calm, majestic, and devoted "father" guiding his "children" (the PCs and their allies) down a path they believe is rebellion, but is in fact, the path to his ultimate victory.

This entire deception hinges on a single, pivotal moment.

## II. The Ultimate Mechanic: The Echo Save

At the moment the **[Sentinel's Heart]** egregor is born on the battlefield, the resulting psychic shockwave rips a hole in reality. This is the moment Xevir, in his divine omniscience, chooses to plant the seed of his grand deception. He hijacks the psychic senses of the party's most powerful oracle, **Isolde**, and presents her with a vision.

Her ability to see through this vision—or her failure to do so—is the single most important dice roll of the campaign. This is **The Echo Save**.

#### **The Trigger**

This occurs at the exact moment of Lola's kiss, as previously scripted in the "Psychic Echo" scene. The flash of golden-iron light acts as the catalyst.

#### **The Save**

> **Isolde must make a DC 20 Wisdom Saving Throw.**

This is not a simple check. This is the moment the fate of the campaign branches. The players should understand, through your tone and description, that this is a moment of supreme, world-altering importance.

## III. The Two Paths: The Consequences of the Roll

The result of this single roll determines which "truth" the party carries forward, setting the stage for one of two campaign finales.

#### **On a Success (The Truth is Glimpsed)**

* **The Vision:** Isolde succeeds in piercing the veil. She witnesses the vision of the "False Victory" as we scripted it: the unknown champion, the shattered mask, the empty throne.
* **The Paradoxical Revelation:** However, because she succeeded, Xevir's mask of deception slips for a fraction of a second. As the vision shatters, she hears his calm, fatherly voice whisper directly in her soul:
    > *"So beautiful, isn't it? The victory you long for. Hold onto that feeling, my child. It will make your service all the sweeter."*
* **The Consequence:** The party now carries a terrible seed of doubt. They know a god *can* be killed, but they also have the first, terrifying clue that they are being manipulated. Their quest becomes twofold: find the god-killing champion (Aisyle) and unravel the true nature of Xevir's plan.

#### **On a Failure (The Lie is Believed)**

* **The Vision:** Isolde fails to see the deception. She witnesses the "False Victory" exactly as Xevir intends: a pure, triumphant, and seemingly true vision of a god's death.
* **The Consequence:** The party now operates under the powerful and incorrect belief that Xevir is either dead or that his death is imminent and achievable. They will follow the path of the Blue Moon Ritual with hope and conviction, unknowingly walking directly into his trap. This sets them up for the ultimate, horrifying reveal: the moment they complete the ritual, only to find they have crowned the very god they meant to kill.

## IV. The Endgame: The Rewind

Regardless of the path, the campaign culminates in the Blue Moon Ritual. But now, the outcome is framed by that single, long-ago roll.

* If they **succeeded** on The Echo Save, they may have a chance (however slim) to subvert the ritual at the last moment, having spent the campaign gathering clues to Xevir's true plan.
* If they **failed**, they are doomed to be his accomplices. After he ascends, he can enact his final, loving, terrible act: rewinding time and placing their conscious, memory-filled minds right back on that watchtower in Session 5.

He will give his beloved children the one thing he knows they truly long for: **another chance to try.** And thus, "Season Two" begins.
