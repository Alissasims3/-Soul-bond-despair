# 📕 **Codex Egregora**

_A Grimoire of Emotional Resonance, Alchemical Frequencies, and Divine Resistance_

> _“You don’t remember them because they were powerful. You remember them because they mattered.”_

---

## 🧬 **Codex Structure**

Each egregor in the Codex includes:

- **Name (Known Name or Nickname)**
- **Tag(s)**: Emotional resonance keywords
- **Type**: Positive / Twisted / Corrupted
- **Frequency Signature**: Describes how it manifests in the psychic or metaphysical field (e.g., scent, light distortion, time effects)
- **Associated Resistance / Effect**: What it protects or empowers
- **Known Ritual Interactions**: Rituals that can amplify, manipulate, or sever it
- **Corruption Risk**: How Xevir might twist or weaponize it

---

## 💠 **Sample Egregors**

---

### 🌿 **Egregor: _The Thread Between_**

> _“Wherever you go, I will follow. Even if I forget my name.”_

- **Tags:** Compassion, Memory, Devotion
- **Type:** Positive
- **Frequency Signature:** Flickers of static during silence; eyes dilate unnaturally in proximity
- **Resistance:**
    - +2 to all saves vs _domination or possession_ if within 60 ft. of bonded target
    - Once per long rest, may automatically succeed on a concentration save
- **Ritual Interactions:**
    - Strengthened by _Heartfire Communion_
    - Severed by _Rite of the Mirror Veil_ if one participant forgets the other
- **Corruption Risk:** If twisted, becomes _The Thread That Chokes_ — forms a feedback loop of control, domination, and forced protection ("I’ll never let them go")

---

### 🪞 **Egregor: _The Reflected Gaze_**

> _“They saw me. Not what I wanted to be—but what I truly was.”_

- **Tags:** Acceptance, Vulnerability
- **Type:** Positive
- **Frequency Signature:** Mirrors fog slightly in its presence; surface reflections ripple faintly
- **Resistance:**
    - Immune to Xevir’s **Mask of the Pain-Humans**
    - +2 to Insight and Deception checks when defending or protecting the bonded person
- **Ritual Interactions:**
    - Can be used as a conduit in **Vault-Key Restoration Rites** to unlock sealed memories
- **Corruption Risk:** May be flipped into _The Judge’s Mirror_ — where reflection becomes fixation, and a partner’s flaws are magnified into obsession or revulsion

---

### 🔥 **Egregor: _The Fire Kept Burning_**

> _“Even when everything died, I kept the hearth lit.”_

- **Tags:** Endurance, Hope, Grief
- **Type:** Positive
- **Frequency Signature:** Heat signatures remain even in cold regions; shadows flicker like firelight
- **Resistance:**
    - Auto-succeed one death save per long rest (if bonded partner is alive and within 100 ft.)
    - Advantage on Wisdom saves while under exhaustion or despair effects
- **Ritual Interactions:**
    - Central to the ritual _Flame of the Shared Vigil_
- **Corruption Risk:** If grief is left unresolved, turns into _The Ember That Devours_ — a self-consuming loop where the character destroys everything around them trying to "keep the fire alive"

---

### 🩸 **Egregor: _The Thorned Bond_**

> _“I’d rather bleed than let them go.”_

- **Tags:** Obsession, Loyalty, Fear
- **Type:** Twisted (unstable)
- **Frequency Signature:** Heartbeats echo unusually loud; the taste of metal or copper near the partner
- **Resistance:**
    - Can **reroll one failed save** against fear per day
    - Once per long rest, you may intercept an attack against the bonded person (take double damage)
- **Ritual Interactions:**
    - Strengthened by _Rite of the Mirror Veil_
    - Weakened by mutual confession of fears or _Egregoric Reflection Rites_
- **Corruption Risk:** Can easily be turned into _The Coil of Ownership_, leading to psychic domination over the bonded target
---

### 🕊️ **Egregor: _The Forgotten Name_**

> _“I don’t remember who they were. But I remember the feeling.”_

- **Tags:** Grief, Memory, Loss
- **Type:** Positive
- **Frequency Signature:** Time anomalies (brief déjà vu), whispers at the edge of dreams
- **Resistance:**
    - Advantage on saves vs memory loss and confusion
    - Once per long rest, restore one memory lost to Xevir (or protect another’s)
- **Ritual Interactions:**
    - Vital for _Fractal Thread Rebinding_
- **Corruption Risk:** If grief is suppressed, it mutates into _The Hollow Refrain_—a nihilistic echo that causes memory rot in allies nearby

---

## 🧠 **Egregor-Driven Mechanics**

### ✨ Bonded Aura (for Radiant Egregors)

If both participants maintain a **7+ score**, they may project an **aura** once per long rest:

- **30 ft. radius for 1 minute**
- Allies auto-succeed on saving throws vs _charm, fear, and psychic effects_  
- Xevir’s minions take **2d6 radiant** damage when starting their turn in the aura

### 💢 Psychic Overload (for Inverted Egregors)

If a corrupted egregor reaches **10** (via toxic reinforcement or rituals):

- The bonded person becomes **hostile**, or **possessed by a false persona**
- The egregor may erupt as a **manifested thoughtform** (CR 6–12), reflective of the corrupted bond
- Xevir is immediately alerted of the location and can send elite enforcers or **Fractal Choirs**

## 🧩 Bonus Use: Codex as Physical Artifact

**The Codex Egregora** can exist in-world as a sentient tome:

- Written in shifting script that reveals new egregors **only when emotionally earned**
- Can be used to **rebuild broken bonds** or **predict corruption vectors**
- If stolen by Xevir cultists, it can be **inverted**, spreading psychic malware across egregors in the region

---

## ⚙️ Integration Hooks:

- 🎭 An NPC’s **egregor is unraveling**—can the PCs identify and stabilize it before it inverts?
- 📚 A forbidden egregor, _The Vow Forgotten_, is rumored to be sealed in the [[📚Library_of_the_Mind]].
- 💔 A corrupted egregor creature (like a **Bondwraith** or **Memory Leech**) hunts those with radiant love.
