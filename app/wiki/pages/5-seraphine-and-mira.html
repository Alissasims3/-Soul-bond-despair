<blockquote>
<p><em>“She was given a gift, not a wound.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="names-type">👥 Names &amp; Type</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seraphine</strong> (Mother)</li>
<li><strong>Mira</strong> (Daughter)</li>
<li><strong>Race:</strong> Human</li>
<li><strong>Faction:</strong> Hidden followers of <strong>Xevir</strong>, the God of Longing</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="appearance">🧬 Appearance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seraphine:</strong> Gaunt, hollow-eyed, draped in dark, threadbare robes. Moves with eerie serenity.</li>
<li><strong>Mira:</strong> Pale child with a crude wooden leg, missing her right limb. Always watching. Rarely speaks. Occasionally hums… oddly dissonant tunes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="personality-demeanor">💭 Personality &amp; Demeanor</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seraphine:</strong> Soft-spoken, unnervingly calm. Her words carry unsettling finality.</li>
<li><strong>Mira:</strong> Silent, hauntingly perceptive. Never cries. Her gaze lingers too long.</li>
<li><strong>Presence:</strong> They never speak of Xevir aloud—but their glances, whispers, and passive influence leave a <strong>psychic shadow</strong> wherever they go.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="hidden-backstory">🕳️ Hidden Backstory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Seraphine was once a healer until her village was slaughtered. In the ashes, she found <strong>clarity</strong> in Xevir’s entropy.</li>
<li>Mira lost her leg in that same event. Seraphine believes it was not a tragedy—but a <strong>marking</strong>.</li>
<li>Their bond is unbreakable, their grief sublimated into quiet devotion.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="motivation">🎯 Motivation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subversion, not conversion.</strong><br />
    They are <strong>seed-planters</strong>, not preachers. Their mission is to let doubt grow like mold—unseen until it consumes.</li>
<li><strong>Mira is rumored to be “touched”</strong>—some say she can see things others can’t.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="plot-hooks">🧩 Plot Hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Seraphine might begin whispering to an emotionally vulnerable party member.</li>
<li>Mira could lead a PC to a hidden symbol or location tied to Xevir.</li>
<li>At a pivotal moment, the pair may <strong>vanish</strong>—leaving behind <strong>only a bloom of white fungus</strong> or a bloodless husk.</li>

<h1 id="seraphine-mira-within-the-caravan">🕯️Seraphine &amp; Mira within the Caravan</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We don’t preach. We wait. The silence always makes them listen.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="role-in-the-caravan">👁️ Role in the Caravan</h2>
<p>Seraphine and her daughter Mira are <strong>unofficial spiritual figures</strong> traveling quietly within the caravan. While not recognized as part of the leadership, they are <strong>trusted healers by some</strong>, and <strong>deeply unsettling to others</strong>. Their presence is tolerated by Captain X’sa because they follow orders, provide aid… and never cause direct trouble. But many sense something is <em>off</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Role:</strong> Aid-givers, watchers, soft counselors in the night.</li>
<li><strong>Secret Role:</strong> <strong>Subtle infiltrators</strong> for <strong>Xevir’s influence</strong>, planting doubt, emotional weakness, and fatal curiosity.</li>
<li><strong>Known By:</strong> The zealot pair is mostly left alone. Some guards avoid them entirely. The <strong>fanatic healer Brother Halvard</strong> and <strong>Prophet Malk</strong> share <em>unspoken nods</em> when passing them.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="behavior-in-the-caravan">📜 Behavior in the Caravan</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seraphine</strong> walks the outer rings of camp, especially at night. She often appears where grief lingers.</li>
<li><strong>Mira</strong> sits near the dead or wounded, sometimes humming lullabies that <strong>mirror long-forgotten prayers to Xevir</strong>.</li>
<li>They <strong>attend every burial</strong>, saying nothing, but always watching.</li>
<li><strong>No one has ever seen them sleep.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="narrative-use-in-the-caravan">🔥 Narrative Use in the Caravan</h2>
<p>These zealots are <strong>slow-burn threats</strong>, ideal for tension-building or philosophical dread:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whisperers:</strong> Seraphine speaks gently to those losing hope. She always finds the weak spots.</li>
<li><strong>Seed Planters:</strong> Mira leaves <em>drawings in ash</em> or <em>fungal blooms</em> where future calamity occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Distortion:</strong> PCs may experience <strong>warped dreams</strong> or emotional echoes after extended time around them.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict Sparkers:</strong> When leadership falters or food runs short, Seraphine may stir doubts:<br />
<em>“Maybe the gods abandoned you because you clung too tightly to the wrong ones.”</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="hidden-facts-gm-knowledge-only">🧩 Hidden Facts (GM Knowledge Only)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mira is <strong>partially touched by Xevir</strong>, not yet Sporekind, but <em>drifting toward it</em>. She does not dream—<strong>she <em>remembers</em> what others forget</strong>.</li>
<li>Seraphine <strong>once served in Naivara’s faith</strong>, making her betrayal sting especially hard to devout followers.</li>
<li>They have <strong>secret symbols etched into the underside of their wagon</strong>, invisible to the uncorrupted.</li>
</ul>
