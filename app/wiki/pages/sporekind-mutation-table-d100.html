            <p>Here is the fully revised and expanded <strong>Sporekind Mutation Table (d100)</strong>, incorporating all the rich lore and concepts we've built from your various sources.

<h2 id="iv-aberrantweird-mutations-91100">IV. Aberrant/Weird Mutations (91‚Äì100)</h2>

<ol>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Singing Veins:</strong> Your veins are visibly distinct, pulsing with faint light. When you move or use magic, they hum with a low, ethereal melody audible to those who listen closely. This hum may subtly affect others' emotions (DM's discretion).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Void-Glimmer Skin:</strong> Your skin occasionally shimmers with motes of void-light, like tiny, distant stars. This makes you unsettling but also immune to any magic that targets vision (e.g., <em>Blindness/Deafness</em> based on sight, <em>Color Spray</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temporal Skip (Minor):</strong> Once per long rest, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to teleport 5 feet. However, you appear slightly out of sync with time, causing the next creature to attack you to have disadvantage.</p>

When you target a creature with a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can attempt to make them feel a longing for something specific (chosen by you).
