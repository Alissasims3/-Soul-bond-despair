<h2 id="the-vision-pool-whispers-from-the-choir">🧠 <strong>The Vision Pool: “Whispers from the Choir”</strong></h2>
<p>A deck of modular visions for <a href="#isolde">Isolde</a>, triggered by psychic trauma, critical failures, or narrative necessity. They are whispers from her patron, fragments of a shattered reality, and echoes of a past she cannot remember.</p>
<p><strong>Trigger Conditions:</strong>
* On a <strong>natural 1</strong> on any d20 roll (as per her <em>Madness Lurks</em> trait).
* On a failed Wisdom saving throw against fear, madness, or psychic damage.
* Narratively, when encountering a person, place, or object of immense psychic resonance (e.g., Aisyle, an artifact of Xevir, the Philosopher's Seed).</p>
