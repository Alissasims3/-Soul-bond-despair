            <h2 id="interlude-divine-memory-flashback-before-the-ember-broke">🕯️ Interlude: Divine Memory Flashback — <em>“Before the Ember Broke”</em></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A memory not summoned, but demanded. Truth doesn’t knock—it burns its way in.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="scene-somewhere-between-light-and-silence">[Scene: Somewhere Between Light and Silence]</h3>
<p>As Xevir’s mask splinters, the battlefield slows.</p>
<p>The air bends.</p>
<p>Time folds inward.</p>
<p><strong>Aisyle</strong> falters—not from injury, but from the force of an emotion <strong>not her own</strong>.<br />
She sees… <strong>herself</strong>, but not quite. A smaller version. No fangs. No flames.</p>
<p>A young girl, laughing in the arms of a priestess whose face is bright with moonlight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Voice (soft, feminine, and warm):</strong><br />
<em>“You were always too bright for me to hold…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the light fades.</p>
<p>The laughing child is torn away—plucked from soft arms by red-robed shadows.<br />
The mother screams. A name echoes—</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Juliana—”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Aisyle gasps.</p>
<p>She remembers.<br />
<strong>That wasn’t her memory.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It was her mother’s.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sister Lira.</strong><br />
The woman who serves Xevir. Who feeds the flame behind his throne.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I was born from her despair... and I carry it like a torch.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suddenly, her <strong>Coin of Final Judgment</strong> begins to heat—glowing in her palm.<br />
A third side tries to form.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t finish.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If Aisyle fails a Wisdom Save this round, she gains +1 to her next attack AND must <strong>declare an emotional vow</strong> aloud (e.g., “I will never let another child burn for someone else’s god.”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This vow unlocks a one-time <strong>[Karmic Flashstrike]</strong> in the next phase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deal bonus radiant damage equal to her <strong>Charisma + Wisdom</strong> modifier (total +9), once.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<p>This flashback explains <strong>why Xevir’s mask begins to bleed</strong>—because what breaks him is not power.</p>
<p>It’s <em>memory</em>.</p>
<p>His lie can’t survive Aisyle’s truth: <strong>she was never his.</strong></p>
<p>She was someone’s child. Someone’s hope.</p>
<p>And now, she burns not for survival, but for <strong>release</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aisyle (quiet, shattering):</strong><br />
<em>“I wasn’t born to burn. I was stolen to burn. That’s the difference.”</em></p>
