<h3 id="condition-despair-homebrew-suggestion">😨 <strong>Condition: Despair (Homebrew Suggestion)</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A shadow cast by Xevir across the soul.</p>

<p><strong>Each Level of Despair</strong> causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>-1 to Insight, Perception, and Saving Throws vs Fear or Charm</li>
<li>Disadvantage on 1 Wisdom or Charisma check per day (DM’s choice)</li>
<li>Can be cured via <em>Greater Restoration</em>, <em>Heroic Inspiration</em>, or a successful moment of catharsis in RP</li>
</ul>
<p>Maximum Levels: 3
At 3 Despair, Isolde risks momentary possession or complete collapse during future Hymns.</p>

<h2 id="voiceover-technique">🗣️ <strong>Voiceover Technique</strong></h2>
<p>Create psychological <strong>duality</strong> by splitting your narration between the party and Isolde:</p>
<h3 id="to-the-whole-party">🔊 To the <strong>Whole Party</strong>:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The atmosphere thickens like fog inside your lungs. The air turns iron-cold. Somewhere behind your perception, something old and divine shifts its gaze."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="to-isolde-quietly-or-through-private-message">👁️‍🗨️ To <strong>Isolde</strong> (quietly or through private message):</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The Choir falls silent. Not silenced—</em><em>dismissed</em><em>. And in the stillness, a new voice rises: familiar, intimate, inescapable. Xevir speaks—not with cruelty, but with affection so twisted it becomes blasphemy."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="sample-taunts">🕯️ <strong>Sample Taunts</strong></h2>
<p>Here are some personal taunts from Xevir, written in the style of the example you provided.</p>
<h4 id="taunt-1-regarding-the-miracle"><strong>Taunt 1: Regarding the "Miracle"</strong></h4>
<p><em>(Triggered after witnessing the birth of the Sentinel's Heart egregor)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, do you feel that? A flicker of hope. How quaint. Let them have their little miracle. All it does is make the vintage of their inevitable despair that much sweeter for the harvest."</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="taunt-2-regarding-her-purpose"><strong>Taunt 2: Regarding Her Purpose</strong></h4>
<p><em>(Triggered when she feels a sense of victory or accomplishment)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Brave little vessel. Did you think they saved you? You were never a sacrifice, my dear. You were the offering, and you served your purpose so, so beautifully during your Ascension."</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="taunt-3-regarding-her-power-source"><strong>Taunt 3: Regarding Her Power Source</strong></h4>
<p><em>(Triggered after she uses a power from the Crawling Choir)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You cling to those whispers, thinking they are your strength. They are just the echoes from my banquet table, the scraps of thoughts I have already devoured. You are drinking my leftovers and calling it power."</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="taunt-4-regarding-her-identity"><strong>Taunt 4: Regarding Her Identity</strong></h4>
<p><em>(Triggered during a moment of introspection or when she learns a piece of her past)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They call you 'Isolde.' A pretty name for a hollowed-out thing. I remember your <em>real</em> name. Shall I tell you what it was, before I rewrote you?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mechanic will make Xevir an unforgettable, terrifying, and deeply personal antagonist for your entire party, especially for Isolde.</p>
<p>Feel free to rotate or escalate the tone across sessions—from unsettling to <strong>devastating</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="taunt-5-about-hope">🧩 <strong>Taunt 5: About Hope</strong></h3>
<p><em>(Trigger: Party has a breakthrough or small victory)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Ah, there it is. That flicker of belief. It’s always hope that makes you taste best in the end. Ripen a little more, my child. Let yourself believe you matter."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="taunt-6-about-free-will">🧩 <strong>Taunt 6: About Free Will</strong></h3>
<p><em>(Trigger: Isolde defies him in action or words)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"You confuse the illusion of rebellion for choice. I set the stage, placed your marks, and tuned your mind like a harpstring. Even your defiance was rehearsed. Go on—sing your little note."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="taunt-7-about-the-party">🧩 <strong>Taunt 7: About the Party</strong></h3>
<p><em>(Trigger: Isolde leans on or protects another PC)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"You still think they’re yours? They’re mine. I let you borrow them for this little play. And when the curtain falls, you’ll hand them back to me. That’s the role you were born for."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="taunt-8-about-the-eye">🧩 <strong>Taunt 8: About the Eye</strong></h3>
<p><em>(Trigger: The Unseen Eye pulses or is noticed)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"They whisper about it, you know. The Eye. They wonder what it means, if it curses you. But you never wonder what </em>you<em> look like through it, do you? Would you like to know what I see?"</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="optional-enhancement-psychic-echo-table-d20">🌙 Optional Enhancement: Psychic Echo Table (d20)</h2>

<h2 id="design-philosophy">🧠 Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>This mechanic is powerful not just because of what it <strong>does</strong>, but because of what it <strong>means</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It turns Isolde's own powers and progress into avenues of <em>invasion</em>.</li>
<li>It makes her a battlefield of self.</li>
<li>It cements Xevir not just as a god, but as a parasite of the soul—feeding on <strong>intimacy</strong>, <strong>memory</strong>, and <strong>identity</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every time this happens, the message to the table is clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>He is not just watching. He is inside the story. Inside </em><em>her</em><em>.</em></p>

<h3 id="mechanic-xevirs-hymn_1"><strong>Mechanic: Xevir's Hymn</strong></h3>
<p>This mechanic triggers when Isolde's connection to the psychic aether is most active or vulnerable.</p>
<h4 id="triggers"><strong>Triggers:</strong></h4>
<p>You can trigger this mechanic at key moments, such as:
* When Isolde uses a major power granted by the Crawling Choir.
* When the party is in a location with high psychic resonance (e.g., near the smoldering remains of The Listener).
* When a character has a vision or a significant emotional breakthrough (like the birth of the [Sentinel's Heart] egregor).
* Anytime you, the DM, feel it would be dramatically appropriate.</p>
<h4 id="the-save"><strong>The Save:</strong></h4>
<p>When a trigger occurs, the Crawling Choir in Isolde's mind briefly falls silent, replaced by a single, resonant, and terribly familiar voice.
* <strong>Isolde must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.</strong> The DC can range from 13 (for a faint whisper) to 17+ (during a moment of intense psychic power).</p>
<h4 id="consequences-of-failure"><strong>Consequences of Failure:</strong></h4>
<p>If Isolde fails the save, she is subjected to one of Xevir's taunts. You can choose the severity based on how badly she failed.
* <strong>Tier 1 (Simple Failure):</strong> Isolde clearly hears the taunt and takes <strong>1d6 psychic damage</strong> as the words cut into her mind. The rest of the party might feel a sudden chill or a wave of unexplained dread.
* <strong>Tier 2 (Failure by 5 or more):</strong> In addition to the taunt and psychic damage, Isolde gains <strong>1 level of Despair</strong>. The words cling to her, poisoning her resolve.
* <strong>Tier 3 (Critical Failure/Natural 1):</strong> In addition to the above, Isolde is <strong>Frightened</strong> of an unseen presence for 1 minute. The voice is so powerful and clear it feels like Xevir is standing right behind her.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="running-the-voiceover"><strong>Running the Voiceover</strong></h3>
<p>When this happens, first describe the general feeling to the whole party, then deliver the personal taunt directly to Isolde's player.</p>
<p><strong>You (as DM to the party):</strong> &gt; <em>"A sudden, profound cold washes over all of you on the watchtower. For a moment, the air feels heavy with a terrible, ancient sorrow, a feeling of being watched by something vast and possessive."</em></p>
<p><strong>You (as DM to Isolde):</strong> &gt; <em>"Isolde, the chaotic whispers of the Choir in your head are instantly silenced. They are replaced by a single, calm, masculine voice that you recognize not from memory, but from the very marrow of your bones. It speaks directly into your thoughts, its tone a horrifying mix of intimacy and contempt."</em></p>
