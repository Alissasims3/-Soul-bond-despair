<h2 id="tips-for-use">✅ Tips for Use</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast Rolling:</strong> Roll <code>1d6</code> for category → roll within that group.</li>
<li><strong>Keep It Fluid:</strong> If a particular vision fits the scene, skip rolling and just choose.</li>
<li><strong>DM Fiat:</strong> Modify effects for pacing—e.g., Despair Points, fear, Insight checks, or temporary buffs/debuffs.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat Visions:</strong> If needed, let visions repeat or evolve slightly (e.g., the same scene seen from a new angle or with new sensory detail).</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Solar Arena:</strong> <em>You see a gladiatorial pit of black sand under a sun that burns white-hot. A woman with hair of flickering flame and veins of molten gold cuts down a hulking, fungal beast.

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Burning Whip:</strong> <em>The image of a whip, not of leather but of pure, solidified sunlight, coiling in the air. It strikes, and the sound is not a crack, but a solar flare. It leaves a weeping wound of karmic justice on its target.</em></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Grey emptiness. A billion prayers form a tear-shaped crystal. "They are in such pain..."</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>The God of Nothing:</strong> <em>You see a vast, grey emptiness. A chorus of a billion desperate prayers from a dying world slowly coalesces, like mist forming into a single, perfect, tear-shaped crystal. You hear a voice—his voice, but young, hollow—whisper, "They are in such pain. I will hold it for them."</em></li>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blood on the Sun:</strong> <em>You see a noble, fiery god with the face of a vengeful sun (Ikris). A shadowy figure, impossibly handsome and sorrowful, offers him a pact. The fiery god agrees, and you watch as his divine blood is drained, used to tear a hole in the sky. The shadow weeps as he does it.</em></li>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Shattered Hope:</strong> <em>You witness the fall of a great sorcerer robed in flame (Malzarius). As Xevir's blade strikes him down, the sorcerer's body doesn't bleed—it shatters into a thousand tiny embers that scatter on the wind, each one a flickering spark of defiance.</em></li>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Isolde's True Ritual:</strong> <em>You see a younger version of yourself, not in a loving embrace, but strapped to a cold, black altar. Xevir stands over you, his face a mask of profound sorrow. He isn't trying to possess you; he's carefully, surgically, extracting a tiny, crying infant from your womb. "I will protect you from this world," he whispers to the child.</em> </li>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regina's Hair:</strong> <em>You see Xevir from behind, standing in a quiet, ornate room.

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Broken Toy:</strong> <em>The same young girl (Regina) runs to Xevir, crying, holding a beautifully crafted wooden bird with a snapped wing. Xevir kneels, taking it with impossible tenderness. He whispers a word, and a thread of golden light stitches the wing back together. He hands it back to her, his expression one of paternal softness that you have never seen.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Disadvantage on next INT-based skill check. Memory becomes "soft."<br />

<blockquote>
<p>The world is singing mouths; you are a note in the song.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You are immune to fear until end of next encounter. Then gain 1 Despair.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>A woman dies smiling as Xevir inhales her soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>You see a grand, cathedral-like hall. Hundreds of Xevir's followers are kneeling, their faces upturned in rapturous joy. Xevir, looking serene and benevolent, walks among them. He gently touches a woman's forehead. Her body goes limp, a peaceful smile on her face, as a shimmering thread of silver-blue light—her soul—is drawn from her mouth and nose. Xevir inhales it gently, like the scent of a flower, and his eyes glow with a soft, satisfied light. The body left behind is an empty, placid husk.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> DC 13 WIS save or become charmed by Xevir for 1 minute.<br />
<strong>Tag:</strong> <code>#offering #consumption #joy</code></p>
<h4 id="the-final-hymn">🎼 The Final Hymn</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A dying man speaks his last: "My longing is enough." A tendril takes his soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>You are in a darkened room, filled with the sound of a beautiful, whispered hymn. An old man lies on a simple cot, surrounded by his family. "He is coming for me," the old man whispers, his voice filled not with fear, but with pride. "My longing is finally enough." As he breathes his last, a shadowy tendril snakes from the corner of the room, pierces his chest without leaving a mark, and retracts, pulling his soul with it. The family weeps tears of joy for his divine ascent.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Disadvantage on Insight checks for 1 hour.<br />
<strong>Tag:</strong> <code>#hymn #peacefuldeath</code></p>
<h4 id="the-collective-tithe">🔥 The Collective Tithe</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Across the world, priests slice off pieces of soul. Fireflies fly toward a tower.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>A flash of a thousand faces, all at once. They are Xevir's priests and priestesses across the land. At a coordinated moment, they all begin to chant. As they do, you see them willingly sever a small piece of their own soul—a painful, but ecstatic act of self-mutilation—and offer it up. The fragments of light fly through the air like fireflies, all converging on a single, distant, dark tower.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Spell Save DC –1 for 1d4 hours. Psychic spells may backlash.<br />

<h3 id="the-haunted-unwilling">🧊 The Haunted Unwilling</h3>
<h4 id="the-soul-cages">🧊 The Soul Cages</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Defiant souls re-live regret eternally, powering their own prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Soul Cages:</strong> <em>You are in a vast, misty chamber that feels like it's outside of time and space. Thousands of souls, those who defied Xevir or whose longing was not "pure" enough, are trapped in crystalline cages. They don't scream; they are forced to eternally re-live the single moment of their greatest regret, their sorrow and despair feeding the very structure of their prison. You see a defiant warrior, a hero who fought against him, now weeping endlessly over a childhood mistake.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> DC 15 WIS save or become frightened of failure.<br />
<strong>Tag:</strong> <code>#regret #futility #eternity</code></p>
<h4 id="the-echo-of-defiance">🌀 The Echo of Defiance</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A woman sees Xevir’s face in every memory. Her past becomes a lie.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Echo of Defiance:</strong> <em>You see the soul of a woman who refused to worship him. She is not caged, but she is haunted. Everywhere she turns in the ethereal plane, she sees Xevir's face in the crowds. Every memory she tries to cling to is subtly twisted—the face of her husband is now his, the voice of her child now whispers his dogma. Her own mind has become her eternal tormentor, a prison of longing she can never escape.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Any memory check requires Insight DC 14 to avoid false belief.<br />
<strong>Tag:</strong> <code>#gaslight #haunting #mindprison</code></p>
<h4 id="the-unraveled-man">🧵 The Unraveled Man</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Xevir slowly unravels a soul, thread by thread, consuming memory and skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Unraveled Man:</strong> <em>A horrifying, visceral flash: you see a single, translucent soul of a powerful mage who fought Xevir to the end. Xevir is there, not attacking it, but gently, methodically, pulling it apart thread by thread. With each thread he unravels, a cherished memory is erased, a skill is forgotten, a piece of the mage's identity is consumed and repurposed. The soul's silent scream of dissolution is the most terrifying thing you have ever witnessed.</em></li>
