<h1 id="epilogue-the-name-i-had-forgotten">🌙 <strong>Epilogue: “The Name I Had Forgotten”</strong></h1>
<p><em>A quiet room. A heartbeat. The end of a battle—but not of a life.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="setting-green-church-district-hallows-edge">📍Setting: Green Church District, Hallows Edge</h3>
<p>A soft breeze tickles linen curtains. The haze of late morning filters through vine-covered stained glass. Outside, distant bells toll for the sun—not in worship, but relief.</p>
<p>Aisyle lies in a wide hospital cot, barely rising with each breath. Her arms are wrapped in bandages scorched by plasma. Her side still flickers with faint lines of radiant burn.</p>
<p>At her side:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Skarn Bloodfang</strong>, curled upright in a chair, sword still buckled to his hip. One hand dangles. The other clutches the broken crystal that once belonged to the Winter Palace. He snores like a collapsing forge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beneath the bed, <strong>Sol-Ptica</strong> is a quiet smolder—its body pulsing in sleep, dreams bubbling out as tiny spores of flame that fade before reaching the ceiling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And then—</p>
<p><strong>The door opens.</strong></p>
<p>Soft footsteps. The scent of sage and steam.<br />
A cane taps the ground once. Then stops.</p>
<p><strong>Lira enters.</strong></p>
<p>She carries a ceramic bowl of glowing herbal soup, though her eyes do not look at it. They stare only at the woman in the bed.</p>
<p>For a moment, nothing moves.</p>
<p>Then—</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="aisyle-stirs">💫 Aisyle stirs.</h3>
<p>Eyes flutter. Breath hitches.</p>
<p>“…Skarn?” she murmurs, throat dry.</p>
<p>He doesn’t wake.</p>
<p>She groans. Tries to sit. Fails. Her body is heavy, dense with alchemical change.</p>
<p>Then—</p>
<p><strong>She sees her.</strong></p>
<p>The woman by the bed.<br />
Older. Stern. Familiar.<br />
Her green eye wet with unshed tears.<br />
The scar that cuts across her face catching the sunlight.</p>
<p>Aisyle’s fingers tremble.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You—” she whispers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lira does not speak at first. She simply sets down the bowl. Her hands shake as she brushes hair from Aisyle’s sweat-drenched brow.</p>
<p>Then, she kneels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Forgive me, flameborn.”</strong><br />
“I watched you die… in a fire I helped light. I carved the runes. I brought the blade.”<br />
“And yet you survived. Over and over. Even the gods had to respect it.”<br />
“I spent sixty years praying you’d never remember.”<br />
“And sixty seconds just now… hoping you would.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A long silence.</p>
<p>Aisyle turns her head, eyes half-glazed. But a single tear runs from her left eye—over the royal blue vein at her temple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What’s my name?” she asks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lira closes her eyes. Her voice, small now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Juliana Aisyle Feroliat. Daughter of the High Emberblood.”<br />
“You were born in the twin hour. Half for snow. Half for fire.”<br />
“They took you from me. From us.”<br />
“I gave you up… and I swore never to look back.”</p>
<p>“But you looked back for me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="egregor-update-forgiveness-unlocked">🧬 Egregor Update: [Forgiveness] Unlocked</h3>
<p>This egregor blooms between them now—a new resonance not born from fire or fury, but the willingness to see what was hidden.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="closing-vision">✨ Closing Vision</h3>
<p>In the glass of the window, as Lira sits by her side, Aisyle sees something else. Just for a second:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A tall woman with blue-gold curls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A child in her arms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A forest of flame and snow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She blinks—and it’s gone.</p>
<p>But now… she remembers.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="final-words">🌅 Final Words</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Aisyle turns her face to the light.<br />
“I’ve died enough,” she whispers.<br />
“I think it’s time I lived.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from beneath the bed, Sol-Ptica emits one tiny, satisfied puff of golden flame.</p>
