<p><em>An accounting of the singular, non-replicable divine or mythic emotional entities. These egregors do not simply influence reality; they are pillars upon which reality is built. To encounter one is to witness the very grammar of the cosmos, a force that defines an age or ends one.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Egregor Name:</strong> [The Gentle Collector]</li>
<li><strong>Aliases:</strong> The Final Threshold, The Death of Remembrance, The Whisper in the Frost, She-Who-Is-Both, Winter's Maw</li>
<li><strong>Primary Tags:</strong> #Compassion, #Memory, #Devotion, #Threshold, #Mercy, #Judgment, #Peace</li>
<li><strong>Category:</strong> Unique</li>
<li><strong>Source or Origin:</strong> This egregor is the singular, divine essence of <strong>Naivara</strong>, the Veiled Lady of the Blue Moon. She is an ancient, proto-divine psychopomp whose purpose is to shepherd souls and maintain the balance of life and death. This egregor does not have a traditional origin but is a fundamental constant of the cosmos, expressing itself through Naivara's various avatars.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> The egregor's effects are tied directly to which aspect of Naivara is currently manifest.<ul>
<li><strong>Merciful Aspect (Ember, The Quirky Caretaker):</strong> Her presence actively mitigates despair. Allies in her presence may feel a profound calm. Mechanically, this can lower the party's ambient Despair Score over time and stabilize flickering or unstable egregors. Her "Merciful Step" reaction can cause a creature to drop to 1 HP instead of 0.</li>
<li><strong>Judgment Aspect (Wither, The Stern Arbiter):</strong> Her presence enforces cosmic law. This aspect can judge a soul's fate and wields powerful cold and fear effects. Her "Whisper of Ending" can frighten creatures, and her "Drain Warmth" deals cold damage while imposing disadvantage.</li>
<li><strong>Mythic Ascendant (The Hut-Walker):</strong> In times of great imbalance, this aspect emerges. The egregor becomes a terrifying tool of cosmic cleansing. It can forcibly invert or purge corrupted egregors, hunt down those who defy fate, and wield devastating spells like <em>Finger of Death</em> and <em>Power Word Kill</em>. Her mythic form can even meld with her hut, becoming a mobile death-engine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transformation Path:</strong> This egregor does not transform, but its wielder does, shifting the egregor's expression. Naivara's ascension is a path of increasing power and decreasing mercy, a direct response to the state of the world.<ul>
<li><strong>The Path of Ascension:</strong> <code>Ember (Mercy)</code> ‚Üí <code>Wither (Judgment)</code> ‚Üí <code>Duality (Balance)</code> ‚Üí <code>The Hut-Walker (Wrath)</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Egregor Score Effects:</strong> As a Unique Egregor, its score is always considered near-maximum (15-20). It is not a bond players can form but an environmental force they must endure or align with.<ul>
<li><strong>Domain of Influence:</strong> Within 1 mile of her active manifestation, memories of the dead surface vividly, and those near death feel a profound calm. In her ascendant form, the land itself becomes twisted, trails loop back on themselves, and people suffer memory loss in their sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Despair Mitigation:</strong> Her presence in a gentle form can act as a <strong>Counter-Ritual anchor</strong>, stabilizing magic and lowering Despair Scores over time for those who show her respect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rituals or Items Associated:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> A single pale candle in a skeletal hand, wrapped in blooming white roses with a feather at its base. The flame may be half-gold, half-silver in her Duality form.</li>
<li><strong>Ritual:</strong> The <strong>Ritual of the Blue Moon</strong> is likely tied to her, a time when the veil between worlds is thin and her power is at its peak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Visual, Auditory, or Environmental Clues:</strong> The appearance of blue moonlight without a visible moon, the faint scent of herbs and woodsmoke, a soft, inexplicable knocking sound when one is alone, and sudden, vivid visions of deceased loved ones. A spectral bell may toll in her Stern Arbiter form, and flowers may bloom and wilt within the same day when her Duality form is near.</li>
<li><strong>Story Hooks:</strong><ul>
<li>The party possesses an artifact with a deeply corrupted egregor. The only way to cleanse it is to find Naivara in her gentle <strong>Ember</strong> aspect and win her favor, performing a service for the lost souls she protects.</li>
<li>A powerful NPC has cheated death one too many times, creating an imbalance in the cosmos. The party is caught in the middle as Naivara's dreaded <strong>Hut-Walker</strong> aspect manifests to hunt the NPC down, destroying anything that gets in her way.</li>
<li>To find a crucial piece of forgotten lore, the party must seek an audience with Naivara. She will only grant it if they can face her <strong>Duality</strong> form and prove their worth by answering a riddle that satisfies both her merciful and judgmental halves.
Alright ‚Äî here‚Äôs <strong>The Gentle Collector</strong> reformatted for the <strong>Unique Egregors</strong> section so it‚Äôs instantly usable in play and matches a template we can replicate for all others.</li>
