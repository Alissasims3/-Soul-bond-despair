            <p><strong>Prophet Malk</strong>, also known as <strong>Junior Priest Malk</strong>, is a character who serves as a <strong>covert agent and evangelist for the Dark Majesty Cult</strong>, outwardly masquerading as a priest of Naivara.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of Prophet Malk:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identity and Role</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Race/Type:</strong> He is a human, functioning as a cleric, though his true alignment and methods are deceptive.</li>
<li><strong>Public Persona:</strong> He presents himself as a <strong>spiritual guide</strong> in caravans and a priest of Naivara. He appears enthusiastic, poetic, and slightly unhinged. In the Green Church District of Hallows Edge, he potentially influences schools or public services.</li>
<li><strong>True Allegiance:</strong> Malk is a member of <strong>The Fanatical Zealots</strong>, a sub-cell of the <strong>Dark Majesty Cult</strong>, which is Xevir's official and mandatory faith. He is a fully committed zealot. His allegiance to the Dark Majesty Cult means he serves Xevir, the God of Longing.</li>
<li><strong>True Belief:</strong> While outwardly a Naivara priest, he <strong>reinterprets Naivara‚Äôs doctrine</strong> through the lens of Xevir‚Äôs "beautiful decay". He secretly serves a form of Naivara called "The Death That Remembers" but distorts its principles. He is seen as a "necessary instability" and a "firestarter" by other zealots like Brother Halvard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Methods and Influence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deceptive Ceremonies:</strong> He oversees funerals and rites, but his "Naivaran" ceremonies may, in fact, <strong>offer the dead to Xevir</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Memory-Plague Seeds:</strong> He can plant <strong>"memory-plague seeds" in mourning minds</strong>, a tactic to spread Xevir's influence.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Hymns:</strong> He leads public burials and sermons that contain <strong>hidden hymns to Xevir</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Propaganda:</strong> He contributes to the <strong>"Survival &amp; Sanity Guides"</strong> section of the Hallows Press, providing tips for resisting Xevir's influence, coping with psychic strain, and remembering one's own face.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological Manipulation:</strong> He, along with other zealots, spreads Xevir's influence through psychological manipulation, emotional infection, and spiritual erosion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connections and Plot Hooks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zealot Network:</strong> He is part of the coordinated network of Fanatical Zealots, including Brother Halvard and Sister Lira, who infiltrate communities and disguise their true roles.</li>
<li><strong>Corruption Tracking:</strong> Signs of his activities include unmarked graves yielding fungi, indicating his burial rites.</li>
<li><strong>Danger Level:</strong> He is considered a high-danger NPC who may attempt open conversion rituals if left unchecked.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Hooks:</strong> Grave sites where Malk performed burials may begin to <strong>sprout blue fungus</strong>, which in turn attracts Sporekind scouts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, Prophet Malk is a dangerous, morally ambiguous figure who uses the guise of spiritual comfort and healing to further the agenda of Xevir's mind-controlling cult, twisting traditional rites to serve a dark purpose.</p>
