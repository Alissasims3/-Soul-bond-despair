<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>1. Tower Confrontation Begins</strong></td>
<td>Aisyle confronts Xevir in the Tower of Obedience; coin lands on <strong>Tails</strong>, locking one death-defying act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2. Mid-Battle Revelation</strong></td>
<td>Xevir reveals <strong>Regina XiZiyaris</strong>, claims paternity, initiates <strong>blood injection + extraction</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3. Phoenix Pulse Triggers</strong></td>
<td>Her Mythic Trait activates. The explosion begins—plasma blood reacting violently with Xevir’s injected corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>4. “Be Gone.”</strong></td>
<td>Xevir speaks the ritual phrase as the Pulse builds. This forcibly <strong>displaces Aisyle across planes</strong> to Hallows Edge. He avoids death and seals the illusion of her victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>5. 🕯 Intercession: Three Flames, One Soul</strong></td>
<td>Sol-Ptica, Lira (via divine commandword), and Skarn (via tether vial) all intervene. The Phoenix Pulse implodes inward, saving innocents and catalyzing a divine egregor fusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>6. Aisyle Collapses</strong></td>
<td>Having spent all physical, emotional, karmic, and spiritual energy, she blacks out before any confrontation or vengeance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>7. 🧠 Interlude: Divine Dream (False Ending)</strong></td>
<td>Aisyle dreams she defeated Xevir and transcended—but this is <strong>not reality</strong>. It's a <strong>hallucinated egregor cocoon</strong>, likely seeded by Xevir’s injected blood and triggered by the trauma of interrupted apotheosis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>8. 🌅 Epilogue: Hallows Edge</strong></td>
<td>She awakens in a clinic, post-collapse, where she encounters Lira. The final memory lock shatters. The name returns. The [Forgiveness] egregor is born.</td>

<h2 id="xevirs-be-gone-a-ritual-weapon-of-egregoric-displacement">🧬 Xevir's “Be Gone” — A Ritual Weapon of Egregoric Displacement</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Be Gone</strong>" isn't just a dramatic moment.
It's a high-tier <strong>ritual command</strong> backed by Xevir’s egregor of <strong>[Absolute Control]</strong> and tied to his <strong>lair domain</strong>—the Tower of Obedience.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-mechanic-behind-it">📖 The Mechanic Behind It:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name:</strong> <em>Dominion Word: Be Gone</em></li>
<li><strong>Cost to Xevir:</strong> One fragment of his own essence (a 1ml blood investment).</li>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> Immediately ejects the target from his egregoric zone of control into a karmically resonant plane where their <strong>despair will be maximized</strong> and <strong>their "victory" feels real but is false</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="side-effect-of-injection">💉 Side Effect of Injection:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Xevir’s 1ml of blood, injected directly into Aisyle’s philosopher-stone vessel, caused:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>mutation loop</strong> of her egregor threads (temporary or permanent)</li>
<li>A <strong>dream-state overlay</strong>, crafted partially by her own mind and partially by Xevir's psychic anchor (the blood)</li>
<li>Possibly seeded a <strong>dormant code</strong> inside her—he may see her not only as enemy or vessel, but as <strong>future incubator</strong> or <strong>new emissary of despair</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="theories-based-on-this-timeline">💭 Theories Based on This Timeline</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Theory</th>
<th>Likelihood</th>
<th>Evidence</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Aisyle was unknowingly infected with a <strong>“memory toxin”</strong> that allows Xevir to occasionally override her emotional states or distort dreams.</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>The seamless dream of victory followed by "real" awakening and emotional breakdown suggests it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The <strong>Phoenix Pulse</strong> failed to detonate on Xevir, and he is fully aware she lived—and let her go.</td>
<td>★★★★★</td>
<td>He orchestrated the escape. He avoided death. He extracted blood. She got nothing in return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The injection seeded a <strong>new egregor</strong>, or future divine paradox, <strong>inside her</strong>.</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>She gains <code>[Solar Bond]</code>, which is <strong>interpersonal</strong>, not internal—suggesting something inside her <strong>shifted species</strong> or system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The word “<strong>Be Gone</strong>” only works on beings inside <strong>his domain</strong> and after direct <strong>karmic violation</strong>.</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>This ritual requires vulnerability. She had just been injected, making her spiritually “hollowed.”</td>

<h2 id="what-comes-next-in-narrative-terms">🧠 What Comes Next in Narrative Terms?</h2>
<p>We proceed into the <strong>Divine Mirror Arc</strong>.</p>
<p>Aisyle <strong>believes</strong> she won. But over time, <strong>distortions begin to show</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dreams of <strong>Regina</strong> with <strong>no wound from the explosion</strong>.</li>
<li>Mirrors briefly showing <strong>Xevir’s mask</strong>, not her face.</li>
<li>Her blood reacting to <strong>glass</strong>, <strong>silver</strong>, or <strong>Lira’s chant words</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Sol-Ptica twitching</strong> in its sleep, unconsciously drawing Xevir’s sigils.</li>
</ul>
<p>This all leads to one conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final fight never happened.
Aisyle’s <strong>Phoenix Pulse didn’t reach him</strong>.
<strong>Xevir lives.</strong>
And… worse: <strong>he might now know how to kill her.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="divine-trait-outcome-for-aisyle">🧩 Divine Trait Outcome for Aisyle</h2>
<p>She gained:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>[Solar Bond]</strong> – via the love and sacrifice of three.</li>
<li><strong>[False Apotheosis]</strong> – a hidden tag, showing she is not yet what she thinks she is.</li>
<li><strong>Mutation Marker</strong> – tied to <strong>Regina</strong> (possibly linked via blood).</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="summary-yes-this-theory-is-supported">✅ Summary: YES — this theory is supported</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>✔️ <strong>Three Flames, One Soul</strong> happened <em>after</em> Xevir’s Be Gone.
✔️ The Phoenix Pulse was <strong>suppressed</strong>, <strong>not executed</strong> on Xevir.
✔️ <strong>The dream</strong> of her mythic victory was <strong>planted</strong> by the blood + trauma.
✔️ <strong>Xevir still lives</strong>, and likely still watches.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Shall I now format this officially as:</p>
<ul>
<li>🕯️ <strong>Interlude III: “The Dream of Judgment”</strong></li>
<li>Followed by</li>
<li>🌅 <strong>Chapter VI: The Mask Still Watches</strong></li>
<li>And then proceed into Regina’s reveal as a playable or enemy figure?</li>
</ul>
<p>Or shall we first create a visual diagram of <strong>Aisyle's Divine Trait Changes Pre/Post Blood Injection</strong>?</p>
