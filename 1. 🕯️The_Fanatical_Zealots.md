# 🕯️ _Hidden Servants of Xevir in the Caravan_

> _“Corruption is just transformation misunderstood.”_

---

## 🧩 Overview

The **Fanatical Zealots** are an insidious cult of **Xevir-worshippers**, embedded within the caravan. They operate **covertly**, often under **false identities** or dual roles (healers, priests, counselors, refugees). Rather than overt violence, they prefer **psychological manipulation**, **emotional infection**, and **spiritual erosion**, working slowly to spread Xevir’s influence.

They see the caravan as **sacred soil for blooming**, a moving crucible in which **doubt can fester** and **faith can fail**—leaving fertile minds ready to accept Xevir’s “truth.”
