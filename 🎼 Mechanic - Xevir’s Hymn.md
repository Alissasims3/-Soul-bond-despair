## ☠️ **Failure Consequences (Tiered)**

| Tier   | Failure Condition | Effect                                                                                                |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1 | Failed save       | 1d6 Psychic Damage + unsettling chill felt by party                                                   |
| Tier 2 | Failed by 5+      | +1 Level of **Despair** (custom condition, see below)                                                 |
| Tier 3 | Nat 1 or DM fiat  | As above, plus **Frightened** (1 min), hallucinations, or full-body possession for a round (optional) |

### 😨 **Condition: Despair (Homebrew Suggestion)**

> A shadow cast by Xevir across the soul.

**Each Level of Despair** causes:

* -1 to Insight, Perception, and Saving Throws vs Fear or Charm
* Disadvantage on 1 Wisdom or Charisma check per day (DM’s choice)
* Can be cured via *Greater Restoration*, *Heroic Inspiration*, or a successful moment of catharsis in RP

Maximum Levels: 3
At 3 Despair, Isolde risks momentary possession or complete collapse during future Hymns.

## 🗣️ **Voiceover Technique**

Create psychological **duality** by splitting your narration between the party and Isolde:

### 🔊 To the **Whole Party**:

> *"The atmosphere thickens like fog inside your lungs. The air turns iron-cold. Somewhere behind your perception, something old and divine shifts its gaze."*

### 👁️‍🗨️ To **Isolde** (quietly or through private message):

> *"The Choir falls silent. Not silenced—**dismissed**. And in the stillness, a new voice rises: familiar, intimate, inescapable. Xevir speaks—not with cruelty, but with affection so twisted it becomes blasphemy."*

---

## 🕯️ **Sample Taunts**

Here are some personal taunts from Xevir, written in the style of the example you provided.

#### **Taunt 1: Regarding the "Miracle"**
*(Triggered after witnessing the birth of the Sentinel's Heart egregor)*
> "Oh, do you feel that? A flicker of hope. How quaint. Let them have their little miracle. All it does is make the vintage of their inevitable despair that much sweeter for the harvest."

#### **Taunt 2: Regarding Her Purpose**
*(Triggered when she feels a sense of victory or accomplishment)*
> "Brave little vessel. Did you think they saved you? You were never a sacrifice, my dear. You were the offering, and you served your purpose so, so beautifully during your Ascension."

#### **Taunt 3: Regarding Her Power Source**
*(Triggered after she uses a power from the Crawling Choir)*
> "You cling to those whispers, thinking they are your strength. They are just the echoes from my banquet table, the scraps of thoughts I have already devoured. You are drinking my leftovers and calling it power."

#### **Taunt 4: Regarding Her Identity**
*(Triggered during a moment of introspection or when she learns a piece of her past)*
> "They call you 'Isolde.' A pretty name for a hollowed-out thing. I remember your *real* name. Shall I tell you what it was, before I rewrote you?"

This mechanic will make Xevir an unforgettable, terrifying, and deeply personal antagonist for your entire party, especially for Isolde.

Feel free to rotate or escalate the tone across sessions—from unsettling to **devastating**.

### 🧩 **Taunt 5: About Hope**

*(Trigger: Party has a breakthrough or small victory)*

> *"Ah, there it is. That flicker of belief. It’s always hope that makes you taste best in the end. Ripen a little more, my child. Let yourself believe you matter."*

---

### 🧩 **Taunt 6: About Free Will**

*(Trigger: Isolde defies him in action or words)*

> *"You confuse the illusion of rebellion for choice. I set the stage, placed your marks, and tuned your mind like a harpstring. Even your defiance was rehearsed. Go on—sing your little note."*

---

### 🧩 **Taunt 7: About the Party**

*(Trigger: Isolde leans on or protects another PC)*

> *"You still think they’re yours? They’re mine. I let you borrow them for this little play. And when the curtain falls, you’ll hand them back to me. That’s the role you were born for."*

---

### 🧩 **Taunt 8: About the Eye**

*(Trigger: The Unseen Eye pulses or is noticed)*

> *"They whisper about it, you know. The Eye. They wonder what it means, if it curses you. But you never wonder what *you* look like through it, do you? Would you like to know what I see?"*

## 🌙 Optional Enhancement: Psychic Echo Table (d20)

On a failed save, roll a **d20 Echo Effect Table** (optional addition). Effects can include:

| Roll  | Echo Effect                                                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2   | Blood from the nose, no pain                                                                      |
| 3–4   | She repeats the last thing Xevir said, out loud, unknowingly                                      |
| 5–6   | A momentary flash of his throne room overlaid on reality                                          |
| 7–8   | A party member hears a fragment of the voice                                                      |
| 9–10  | The Eye glows bright enough to illuminate shadows                                                 |
| 11–12 | Brief paralysis (1 round)                                                                         |
| 13–14 | Touches an object and it turns cold                                                               |
| 15–16 | Sees her reflection smile independently                                                           |
| 17–18 | She momentarily forgets her name                                                                  |
| 19–20 | **She sees herself from Xevir’s perspective**, lovingly, like a painter regarding his finest work |

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This mechanic is powerful not just because of what it **does**, but because of what it **means**.

* It turns Isolde's own powers and progress into avenues of *invasion*.
* It makes her a battlefield of self.
* It cements Xevir not just as a god, but as a parasite of the soul—feeding on **intimacy**, **memory**, and **identity**.

Every time this happens, the message to the table is clear:

> *He is not just watching. He is inside the story. Inside **her**.*

---

---

### **Mechanic: Xevir's Hymn**

This mechanic triggers when Isolde's connection to the psychic aether is most active or vulnerable.

#### **Triggers:**

You can trigger this mechanic at key moments, such as:
* When Isolde uses a major power granted by the Crawling Choir.
* When the party is in a location with high psychic resonance (e.g., near the smoldering remains of The Listener).
* When a character has a vision or a significant emotional breakthrough (like the birth of the [Sentinel's Heart] egregor).
* Anytime you, the DM, feel it would be dramatically appropriate.

#### **The Save:**

When a trigger occurs, the Crawling Choir in Isolde's mind briefly falls silent, replaced by a single, resonant, and terribly familiar voice.
* **Isolde must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.** The DC can range from 13 (for a faint whisper) to 17+ (during a moment of intense psychic power).

#### **Consequences of Failure:**

If Isolde fails the save, she is subjected to one of Xevir's taunts. You can choose the severity based on how badly she failed.
* **Tier 1 (Simple Failure):** Isolde clearly hears the taunt and takes **1d6 psychic damage** as the words cut into her mind. The rest of the party might feel a sudden chill or a wave of unexplained dread.
* **Tier 2 (Failure by 5 or more):** In addition to the taunt and psychic damage, Isolde gains **1 level of Despair**. The words cling to her, poisoning her resolve.
* **Tier 3 (Critical Failure/Natural 1):** In addition to the above, Isolde is **Frightened** of an unseen presence for 1 minute. The voice is so powerful and clear it feels like Xevir is standing right behind her.

---

### **Running the Voiceover**

When this happens, first describe the general feeling to the whole party, then deliver the personal taunt directly to Isolde's player.

**You (as DM to the party):** > *"A sudden, profound cold washes over all of you on the watchtower. For a moment, the air feels heavy with a terrible, ancient sorrow, a feeling of being watched by something vast and possessive."*

**You (as DM to Isolde):** > *"Isolde, the chaotic whispers of the Choir in your head are instantly silenced. They are replaced by a single, calm, masculine voice that you recognize not from memory, but from the very marrow of your bones. It speaks directly into your thoughts, its tone a horrifying mix of intimacy and contempt."*
