## 🕯️ Interlude: Divine Memory Flashback — *“Before the Ember Broke”*

> *A memory not summoned, but demanded. Truth doesn’t knock—it burns its way in.*

---

### [Scene: Somewhere Between Light and Silence]

As Xevir’s mask splinters, the battlefield slows.

The air bends.

Time folds inward.

**Aisyle** falters—not from injury, but from the force of an emotion **not her own**.  
She sees… **herself**, but not quite. A smaller version. No fangs. No flames.

A young girl, laughing in the arms of a priestess whose face is bright with moonlight.

> **Voice (soft, feminine, and warm):**  
> *“You were always too bright for me to hold…”*

Then the light fades.

The laughing child is torn away—plucked from soft arms by red-robed shadows.  
The mother screams. A name echoes—

> **“Juliana—”**

And Aisyle gasps.

She remembers.  
**That wasn’t her memory.**

> *It was her mother’s.*

**Sister Lira.**  
The woman who serves Xevir. Who feeds the flame behind his throne.

> *“I was born from her despair... and I carry it like a torch.”*

Suddenly, her **Coin of Final Judgment** begins to heat—glowing in her palm.  
A third side tries to form.

But it doesn’t finish.

### 📜 [Flashback Mechanic (Optional Rule)]

- If Aisyle fails a Wisdom Save this round, she gains +1 to her next attack AND must **declare an emotional vow** aloud (e.g., “I will never let another child burn for someone else’s god.”)

- This vow unlocks a one-time **[Karmic Flashstrike]** in the next phase:
  > Deal bonus radiant damage equal to her **Charisma + Wisdom** modifier (total +9), once.

### 🔗 [Narrative Tie-In to Chapter IV]

This flashback explains **why Xevir’s mask begins to bleed**—because what breaks him is not power.

It’s *memory*.

His lie can’t survive Aisyle’s truth: **she was never his.**

She was someone’s child. Someone’s hope.

And now, she burns not for survival, but for **release**.

### 📛 [Quote Card Insert — Interlude]

> **Aisyle (quiet, shattering):**  
> *“I wasn’t born to burn. I was stolen to burn. That’s the difference.”*
