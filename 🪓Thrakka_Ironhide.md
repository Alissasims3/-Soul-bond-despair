## 🧬 Mutation #75 – Echoing Doppelganger

> _"There's two of me, I think. One’s behind. Or ahead. Can’t tell no more."_

- **Unnerving Presence:** His afterimage sometimes moves independently—turns, flickers, mimics

---

## 🎭 Personality

- **Trait:** Fidgets constantly, breaks things accidentally, always moving
- **Ideal:** _Honor is my clan’s legacy. I carry it in my blood._
- **Bond:** His tribe’s memory must live on—especially in battle
- **Flaw:** Quick to violence. Deep suspicion of outsiders.
- **Quirk:** Believed red paint warded off death. Would never fight without it.

---

## 🧩 Campaign Role: Pre-Mutation

- **Session 1 Role:** Introduced as comic relief and emotional anchor—protective older-brother energy
- **Player Bonding:** Strong connection to Isolde and Phillipian; guarded Simonny during rest
- **Offscreen Mutation:** While helping evacuees, vanished near the Vault beneath the Forgotten Isles. Next seen as something else entirely…

# ☠️ Thrakka Ironhide – PostSpore

**Status:** Deceased (Undead-Spore Hybrid)  
**Title:** Thrakka the PostSpore, Crimson Bloom Echo

---

## 🧬 Sporekind Reanimation: Dronesteel Hybrid

After succumbing to **The Hive Father's infection**, Thrakka was among the first to mutate beyond death into a **Dronesteel Host**—a crystallized half-fungal sentinel created for worship, memory-encoding, and violence.

### 🧠 Altered State

- **Mind:** Intelligence functionally severed; operates on Hive instinct
- **Speech:** Occasionally whispers broken words from his past (e.g., "red," "home," "no more fire")
- **Voice Layer:** Speaks in two tones—his own and the Hive overlay
- **Aura:** Presence causes unease in divine casters; flashes of ancestral memory haunt those who touch him

---

## 🩸 Sporekind Mutation Echoes

### 🌱 Crystalized Body

His skin and muscles are fused with ruby-colored crystalline spores. The red warpaint has been replicated and ritualized by the Hive—now **perfectly symmetrical**, mimicking sacred geometry.

### 🪞 Doppelganger Persistence

His **Echoing Doppelganger** still functions. The afterimage is now permanently visible—floating just a second behind him, sometimes moving _before_ his actual body reacts.

- **Echo Flicker:** May appear on security footage or in reflections _before_ he enters a space
- **Combat Mechanic:** Still grants Advantage vs charm/frightened. Critical hits may trigger extra psychic pain.

---

## 🛠 Equipment

- **Warpaint of the Ironfang (Corrupted):** Remains visible on his flesh. Now pulses when holy spells are cast nearby
- **Greataxe (Missing):** Last seen buried in the Vault bloom's outer shell. May be recoverable

---

## 📌 Campaign Significance

### 🔮 Lore Hook: Vault Memory Shard

- Thrakka’s mutated body may contain a **Vault Seed fragment**, encrypted into his fungal nervous system. Extracting it could unlock a prophecy or psionic map.

### 💥 Holy Magic Trigger

- Divine spells cast within 10 ft. of his body trigger violent tremors or shrieks. A critical success on **Religion** or **Arcana (DC 18)** reveals the Hive views him as a **flawed but holy artifact**.

### 🔁 Resurrection Risk

- The Sporekind plan to **resurrect him through ritual bloom**, believing he is **“the Chosen of the Red Pattern.”**
- If successful, he may become a **Mycoblessed Warlord**, bonded fully to the Hive Father.

---

## 🧩 Role in Player Story

- **Optional Encounter (Session 4+):** Players can find his crystallized remains beneath the **Ain’t Tree**
- **Choices:**
    - Attempt to cleanse or lay him to rest
    - Speak with Dead (if possible) to access broken memories
    - Stop his resurrection
    - Use his body as a key to awaken part of the **Vault of the Mind**

---

## 📝 Flavor Notes

- **Reflections:** His mirror image moves before he does
- **Color Symbolism:** Red still surrounds him—even the fungal growth glows faintly crimson
- **Brotherhood Echo:** The Listener pauses slightly near his corpse—some primal tie remains

## 🎭 Sample Dialogue (as PostSpore Echo)

> _“Paint... still here... kept me warm... I broke them... for home... no fire... not now...”_  
> _“Felix? Tell Simonny... run.”_  
> _“I still see her... I shouldn’t... but I do.”_
