## 🔥 Lore & Belief
> *"Malzarius did not die — he fractured. Each spark of him ignites the hearts of those who remember."*

- Malzarius led one of the last major rebellions against **Xevir**, wielding ancient, forbidden flame.
- Upon his defeat, his **soul shattered** into scattered *Sparks of the First Sun* — hidden in relics, people, and places.
- Followers believe these sparks awaken inner power, forgotten magic, or courage to resist.
- They await the **Rising Flame**, a future when Malzarius will be reborn through a new vessel (perhaps **Volcanix**).
- His cult was **brutally suppressed** — followers burned, their knowledge erased or twisted by Xevir’s enforcers.

- **Beliefs:** Fire is not just destruction, but memory and rebellion. Every spark carries purpose.
