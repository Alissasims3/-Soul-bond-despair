## üåÄ **Unique Egregors ‚Äì Overview**

Unique egregors are singular, non-replicable divine or mythic emotional entities. They cannot be ‚Äúbred,‚Äù ‚Äúcopied,‚Äù or ‚Äúmanifested‚Äù through ordinary ritual means, and each one has a specific point of origin in the world‚Äôs history. Many interact directly with the Despair Score, Hive Paradox, or Egregor Shard mechanics.

|Attribute|Value|
|---|---|
|**Category**|Unique|
|**Polarity**|Singular ‚Äì fixed identity and resonance; cannot be replicated or artificially generated|
|**Egregor Score Range**|15‚Äì20 (Always at or near maximum; sustains itself without external upkeep)|
|**Resonance Risk**|Extreme ‚Äî interaction always alters local karmic balance and can permanently shift Despair Scores|
|**Vulnerability**|Only vulnerable to mythic-tier counterforces directly tied to its core emotional tags or origin (e.g., Xevir‚Äôs only weakness is genuine, uncorrupted love)|
|**Immunity**|Immune to forced merging, inversion, or erasure through standard rituals or Vizardika techniques|
|**Role**|Acts as a singular nexus of narrative and metaphysical influence; defines or reshapes entire regions, religions, or world epochs|
|**Origin Requirement**|Born from one-time, non-reproducible events (cataclysmic convergence, divine paradox, cosmic bargain, etc.); impossible to reproduce through ordinary egregor synthesis or alchemical fabrication|
|**Manifestation Type**|Always accompanied by unique sensory phenomena and narrative consequences (e.g., altered dreams, regional weather shifts, mass hallucinations, or changes to local emotional baselines)|
|**System Interactions**|May interact with multiple mechanics simultaneously (Despair Score, Egregor Score, Shards, Hive Infection, Philosopher‚Äôs Stone Protocol, Counter-Rituals), often in ways not possible for other types|
