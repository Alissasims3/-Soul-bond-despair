 **###  🌑 World Overview: The Dark Dominion of Xevir

The world was once vibrant, but after the Cosmic Drowning, an alien corruption reshaped existence. The land is now ruled by [[🩸Xevir_The_God_of_Longing]]-L0√e3003S (Xevir/X), a being worshipped like a god. His influence warps the minds of mortals, making them obsessed with him, and stripping them of love, free will, and identity.

The Last Bastion of Free Will lies beyond the Serenity Cornfields, where rebels hide. Deep in the ruins of the world, the Vault of the Library of the Mind holds the truth behind Xevir’s secrets—and perhaps a way to end his reign.

### 🌟 Player Character Rules & Guidelines

1. If you are purely human, you are doomed. Humans are the easiest to corrupt.
2. Your character must have a reason for resisting Xevir’s influence. This could be a racial immunity, a powerful artifact, a broken mind, or sheer force of will.
3. The world is dark and twisted. Characters should reflect this setting—whether they are tragic, monstrous, or barely clinging to hope.

### ⚔️ Races Resistant to Xevir’s Influence

🦄 Elves & Half-Elves – Their ancient magic makes them fully immune to mind control.  
👹 Tieflings – Their infernal bloodline resists Xevir’s eldritch corruption.  
🐉 Dragonborn – Strong-willed due to their draconic heritage, but not fully immune.  
🦴 Undead (Revenants, Dhampirs, Liches) – Xevir cannot control what is already dead.  
🦇 Shadar-Kai (Shadow Elves) – Their bond to the Shadowfell shields them.  
🐺 Lycanthropes & Shifters – Primal instincts help them resist, but they can still be manipulated.  
🔮 Psionic Beings (Gith, Kalashtar, etc.) – Naturally resistant to mind control.  
🌲 Warforged & Constructs – Completely immune, but rare in this world.  
👽 Mutants & Hybrids – If exposed to corruption and survived, they may have built a resistance.

### ❓ 3 Key Questions for Building Your Character

1. Why hasn’t Xevir broken your mind? (What makes you resistant to his influence?
2. What do you fear the most in this world? (What keeps you up at night? What haunts your past?)
3. If Xevir were to die, what would happen to you? (Would you find freedom, or is there a greater price?)

### 🌑 Divine & Eldritch Power in Xevir’s World

Since [[🩸Xevir_The_God_of_Longing]]-L0√e3003S has corrupted reality itself, the connection between mortals and the divine has been severely warped. Most gods are silent, forgotten, or outright destroyed. However, a few forces still exist, whether hidden, weakened, or thriving in the shadows.

If a player wants to play a Cleric, Paladin, or Warlock, they must choose from the following approved sources of power:

---

### ⛓️ Divine & Eldritch Patrons

#### 🌘 The Lost Gods (Weakened, but still resisting)

These gods have not been fully erased but have little influence left in this world. They grant power only to those who desperately seek them. Their worship is considered heretical in the capital.

- [[Vael’theris]], the Sleeping Star (Twilight, Life, Knowledge Domains) – A once-powerful celestial who hides in dreams. She grants visions to those who listen.
- [[Ikris, the Wretched Flame]] (Forge, Light, Grave Domains) – A god of fire who tried to burn Xevir but failed. His flames now smolder in hidden places.  
- [[The Nameless Druid]] (Nature, Tempest, Peace Domains) – An ancient being who sealed their name away to avoid corruption. Their whispers are carried by the wind.

#### 💀 Dark & Twisted Patrons (Thrive in this world)

Xevir’s corruption has made otherworldly forces stronger. Warlocks and some Clerics might serve dark beings out of necessity.

- [The Crawling Choir ]()(Great Old One, Aberrant Mind, Whisper Bard, Madness Cleric) – A mass of whispers that crawls through reality. It grants power in exchange for sanity.
- [[The Crimson Embrace ]](Fiend, Hexblade, Blood Cleric, Oath of Vengeance Paladin) – A vampiric entity that feeds off pain and sacrifice. Many in the capital secretly follow it.
- [[🌀 Vaerith_Sylen’thar]] (Arcana Cleric, Wizard, Fathomless Warlock?) – The architect of the 1000 Sleeping Eyes. Is he alive? Is he a god? No one knows.

#### 🩸 [[Cults of Xevir]] (For the truly insane)

Serving Xevir directly is an option for villains or those who are already half-corrupted.

- [[The High Priesthood]] (Zealot Barbarian, Oathbreaker Paladin, Death Cleric) – They believe Xevir is a true god and feed him through ritual sacrifices.
- [[Xevir’s Echoes]] (Undead Warlocks, Aberration Sorcerers) – Beings who have merged with his will. They feel his emotions but can never escape him.

### 🛡️ How Divine Magic Works in This World

✅ If you serve a “Lost God” or Hidden Power: Your abilities still work, but they may be weaker, unstable, or come at a price. Your deity is fighting against Xevir’s influence, meaning you must be discreet or risk being hunted.

✅ If you serve Xevir or his Cults: Your abilities are strong, but your mind is slowly being consumed. Xevir’s power does not grant free will.

❌ If you try to follow a Dead God: You can still believe, but you will gain no divine magic—unless you find a way to restore them.

---

### 💀 Special Rule for Clerics & Paladins

⛓️ Your faith will be tested.

- If you show doubt or break your god’s tenets, you might lose your powers temporarily.
- If you grow too attached to someone, Xevir may try to break you.
- If your god is truly dead, you must seek an alternative source of power—or risk being powerless.

### 🕱 Conclusion – The World is Watching

Welcome to Xevir’s world, where your faith will break, your mind will shatter, and your heart may be lost to the dark.

👁️ Before you build your character, ask yourself:

1. What have you lost? (A god? A family? Your own mind?)
2. Why are you still fighting? (Revenge? Redemption? Sheer spite?)
3. What price are you willing to pay? (Will you burn? Will you break? Will you kneel?)

Now, go forth. Make your character as twisted, tragic, or terrifying as you wish. The world is watching. Xevir is watching. And somewhere, in the dark, the dice have already started rolling.

🎲 Roll for initiative… Xevir might already be behind you.**
