# 📖 Chapter II: Phase One – “The God Who Wears Faces”

> _“You’ve come to burn down a god? Then burn completely.”_  
> —Xevir, Masked in Longing

---

## 🎭 Setting the Stage: The Tower of Obedience

The capital of Obedience quivers as the outer shell of **Xevir’s Tower** splits like a wound. Blood-colored light pulses from its seams as **Aisyle Flameborn**, Emissary of Solar Wrath, enters.

This is **Xevir’s lair**:  
A cathedral of ego.  
A city-wide altar to Despair.  
A biomechanical temple of flesh, bone, and emotion.

### ⚙️ Layer Mechanics: Tower of Obedience

- **Emotion Bleed:** Any Wisdom save failed inside the tower causes 1 Despair Point gain.
    
- **Ceiling Veins (Phase I):** At initiative 20, the ceiling rains spiritual ichor. PCs must roll a DC 15 Dex save or lose their next reaction.
    
- **Whisper Choir:** At initiative 10, all non-Xevir creatures make a DC 14 Int save or take 2d6 psychic damage (illusory regrets).

## 🎙️ Anime Dialogue: Escanor vs. Chrollo Vibe

> **Aisyle:**  
> “You speak of longing… but all I hear is cowardice dressed in poetry.”

> **Xevir (smiling beneath the mask):**  
> “And you scream like a sun afraid of winter.  
> Why pretend rage is more noble than need?”

> **Aisyle (walking through fire):**  
> “Because my rage gave me reason.  
> What did yours give you? A mask?”

## 🧠 DM Notes – Phase I

- **Xevir avoids direct melee** until the Mask begins to crack (Phase II).
    
- **Use Illusions and Emotional Manipulation:** Let players witness ghostly versions of allies failing, loved ones dying, etc. They are not real—but must be disbelieved with Insight.
    
- **Every failed save grants 1 Despair Score point.** This adds narrative tension and cumulative pressure.
