## üß† **The Vision Pool: ‚ÄúWhispers from the Choir‚Äù**

A deck of modular visions for [[üåÄ Isolde|Isolde]], triggered by psychic trauma, critical failures, or narrative necessity. They are whispers from her patron, fragments of a shattered reality, and echoes of a past she cannot remember.

**Trigger Conditions:**
* On a **natural 1** on any d20 roll (as per her *Madness Lurks* trait).
* On a failed Wisdom saving throw against fear, madness, or psychic damage.
* Narratively, when encountering a person, place, or object of immense psychic resonance (e.g., Aisyle, an artifact of Xevir, the Philosopher's Seed).
